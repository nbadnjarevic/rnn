*I'm not a writer, or even someone who really writes much of anything. However, there have been a couple of other stories with a similar theme on HFY, and after reading one I couldn't get my take on the story out of my head.*League of Species High Council, Messier 18 Cluster, Carina-Sagittarius Arm“I believe that wraps up these proceedings of War,” said the Bonthian Admiral. She was an imposing hexapod, towering 4 meters tall, and her carapace was studded with medals stapled into her bony exoskeleton, a record of military victories a permanent fixture of her body. She was tired of this meeting. Another upstart species on the fringe of League space, and another interminable meeting about which member species ships would be selected in the line of battle to put the upstarts in their place. She surveyed the long, raised table in front of her, flanked on each side by the ranking members of the League Galactic’s Security Council. Below the table, the delegations of lesser council species and junior members stood, perched, sat or coiled depending of their respective physiologies. Admiral Nuryaw sat at the head of the table, flanked by her species’ ambassador’s to the League, befitting her position as the leader of the most powerful military in the security council, and therefore its chair-being.Her medals clanked at her chest carapace as she raised her gavel-stone in her grasping-hoof to dismiss the council, seeing the colored holograms that signaled [approval] blink into existence above the various delegations at the table and the council floor as they keyed in their assent on their speaking stones. She was about to rap the gavel-stone on the table’s surface, when a blinking hologram with the symbols of [dissent] and [request to speak] caught her gaze near the corner of the room, hovering over a delegation far back in the crowd. Some minor race looking to score political points during security proceedings, most likely. As far away from the table as they were, they must have been one of the most junior species present. However, protocol was protocol, and member species were allotted speaking time, after all. “The War-Council recognizes Ambassador Nesh of the ...” Nuryaw paused at the unfamiliar species name, “Dreeden people. You may speak.”On large holo-screens floating high-above the council chamber, the view switched from the decorated admiral to a small, bipedal creature with what looked to be a huge compound eyes on either side of its bulbous head, and upper limbs that ended in a myriad of small, writhing tentacles.The Dreeden Ambassador only stood one meter in height, but his voice reached the entire war-council without the need for amplification. “If it may please the security council, the Dreeden Republic would yield it’s time to a non-voting member species.”This caused a stir on the council floor, as delegations whispered to each other. A junior council species yielding what little time it was allotted on the floor to a non-voting species? This was unheard of. What could a species so new or so minor that they had not achieved voting status in the league have to add to a council of war? Delegations that had a neck to crane now did so, looking at the holo screens to try to get a better look at the Dreeden Ambassador.Nuryaw motioned the delegations to silence with a wave of her fore-hoof. “If only to sate the council’s curiosity, the request is granted. The Ambassador from Dreeden may yield his time.”“Thank you Admiral.” The ambassador passed his speaking stone to a delegation directly to their right. “The Dreeden yield their time to representatives of the Terran People. May I introduce to you Ambassador Baden Woods and Admiral Patricia Davies of the Associated Republics of Terra.” Another bipedal figure accepted the Dreeden's speaking stone. This “Terran” stood twice the height of Ambassador Nesh. Other than the species possessing two limbs for locomotion and two limbs for grasping, not much else was discernible to Nuryaw, as the entire Terran delegation seemed to be wearing full environmental suits with completely opaque helmets. Nonetheless, there was something about their appearance that made Admiral Nuryaw uneasy, as if these Terrans tickled a half-forgotten memory.Nuryaw saw that she wasn’t the only one to be discomfited by the appearance of these Terrans. To her left, the Arkone ambassador had partially withdrawn into his shell, while the Queel Admiral at the foot of the table flicked its mandibles in agitation. What horrors must lurk under that mask! Nuryaw was under no illusions that species found each other pleasing to the eye, but these Terrans truly must be hideous to illicit such a reaction! Her discomfort was quickly replaced by amusement by the thought, and turned to listen to what this Terran delegation could possibly hope to add to the proceedings, while idly calling up information on the species on her personal holo-screen.“Honorable Species of the League, Admiral Nuryaw, we thank you for your time. You do our young species honor to have our words heard by species as wise and as powerful as yours. You have fought many wars, and won many victories.” The human ambassador took a long pause. “Unfortunately, we do not believe this strike against the Rashan will be one of them.”If the spectacle unfolding on the security council chamber’s floor didn’t have every delegation’s attention before, it certainly did now. Nuryaw’s hackle-spines raised along her back. “You presume too much, calfling.” While the information about the Terrans she had been able to pull up on her screen was surprisingly sparse, with remarkably little about the physiology of the creatures beneath their environmental suits, the entry about how recently they became a space-faring species told her enough. “The Bonth were fighting inter-stellar war while your species was using stone tools. You jeopardize your future membership in the league by presuming you have a superior military analysis of the situation.” Around the Security Council chambers, [assent] was signaled by most of the delegations.“You are correct, of course Admiral, with the Bonth leading its fleets, the League has prospered for millennia. We do not assume to question your tactical analysis, but only to suggest that it was made with incomplete information.” Ambassador Woods replied. “We have reason to believe that the Rashan will not wage war in the manner that you expect. We believe that they are a predator species.”Nuryaw stifled a laugh. “A predator species? A sentient, space-faring predator species? Don’t waste our time with that horror story.” Other security council members were not as successful at containing their laughter. “Simple calfing,” Nuryaw sighed, “Three thousand years this League has policed this corner of the Galaxy. Over a thousand sentient species under its protection,” she gestured over the gathered delegations with her fore-hoof. “And never has any of them encountered a sentient - or even close to sentient - predator.”“Surely you have access to the League’s database. It is the struggle against simple predators that evolves sentience! That forces species to use tools! It was our ancestral struggle as prey that was the crucible that forged every species in this League. Predators? Flesh eaters? Capable of space travel? I’m afraid you are mistaken, Terran.” Nuryaw moved once more to adjourn the session, only to hear the Terran speak once more. Her hackle-spines rose again in agitation, but Ambassador Woods didn’t seem to notice.“As implausible as it may seem, it is the truth Admiral. Our intelligence sources managed to find visual records of Rashans outside of their combat armor during one of their recent incursions into league space. Those records show that the Rashans have forward facing eyes, and we believe teeth-analogues that indicate a carnivorous diet. They are predators, and they will wage war like them. Admiral Davies can elaborate, but their tactics will be nothing like those you have fought against before, and if you use the battle plan proposed today, your fleet will not survive.”Despite the Terran Ambassador’s opaque helmet, Nuryaw felt his gaze on her, and again repressed a feeling of unease. What was it about this creature that created that reaction? She brushed the thought aside. “Enough! This council will not be distracted by scientific impossibilities!” Nuryaw once again raised the gavel-stone to adjourn, and grunted with frustration as the symbol for [dissent] blinked insistently above Ambassador Nesh’s head. “You and your pets are trying my patience, Ambassador Nesh.” Nuryaw’s hackle-spines were now fully raised.“If it may please the security council, we would like to suggest an addendum to the battle plans. It is obvious that our Terran friends are terribly ignorant in the ways of war-making, and have let superstition guide their analysis. Surely they have misinterpreted the data. We believe that this could be a learning experience for such a young species, however. What better way for the Terrans to see that there is nothing to fear than to see the League in action?”, the Dreeden Ambassador implored. “Let the Dreeden military escort a small contingent of Terran ships to observe the battle to see for themselves that the mighty League fleet led by the Bothian vanguard will easily route the Rashan from the field.”Nuryaw waved a fore-hoof in exasperation. “If that is what it will take for the Dreeden to quit interrupting these proceedings, then so be it. I will not have their ships interfering with my line of battle, however.”“Of course not, Admiral,” Nesh bowed in the direction of the table. “We would only ask that our escorts and Terran calflings be allowed to engage any targets of opportunity, so that we may have the honor in fighting alongside a League battlefleet.”“You ask for much, but I see no reason to deny your request. How votes the council?” [Assent] appeared across the council chambers, and finally Nuryaw was able to bring the gavel-stone down. As the delegations filtered out of the chamber however, Nuryaw pondered her personal screen. Of course the Terran’s claims were preposterous, but what was it about their appearance that bothered her so much, and why wasn’t she able to find any information on what they looked like under those suits?“Calflings?” Ambassador Baden Woods protested as he poured the much smaller Dreeden ambassador a finger of whiskey from a cut crystal decanter into a rocks glass wrapped in Nesh’s tentacles. The room was well appointed, with paintings of landscapes from Earth and its colonies on the walls. Comfortable looking chairs sat facing a massive walnut desk. It was a cosmological and biological fluke that humans and the Dreeden had similar enough chemistry to enjoy ethanol in a similar manner, but it made inter-species negotiations and state-dinners much more enjoyable, and being able to hash out policy issues over a glass of scotch or pilak was one of the many reasons that the Dreeden and humans were so close as species.Ambassador Nesh looked rather comical sitting in the overstuffed leather lounge chair in Ambassador Baden’s study, feet dangling off the ground. “It worked, didn’t it Baden? You can now get your ships in, and have tactical freedom in the battlespace. Isn’t that what Admiral Davies wanted?”“What I wanted was to have this attack called off in the first place,” a statuesque woman with close-cropped salt and pepper hair and piercing blue eyes said as she entered the room, taking the decanter from Baden’s hands and helping herself to a rock glass. “Gods it’s good to be out of that contact suit. I swear my environmental system was set ten degrees too high.”“We knew that changing their plan wasn’t going to happen, Admiral. The security council, and Nuryaw have done things the same way for millennia and they feel, to borrow a human phrase: if it is not damaged, then why repair it?” “You’re right Ambassador, changing Nuryaw’s mind was probably out of the question,” Baden said, sipping from his own glass as he leaned back on to his desk. “But Admiral Davies is right as well. This battle will be a disaster, and a lot of sentients will die because we weren’t able to convince the security council today. Now it’s up to Patricia and your commanders to figure out a way to save as many of them as possible.”The two Ambassadors and the Admiral stared into their glasses“I can’t help wonder if it would have helped for us to take our helmets off, to show them what we were,” Patricia mused, taking a slow sip.Nesh shook his head sadly. “We’ve been over this Admiral Davies. You know the reaction that my species had when you made contact with us. Predators in space! You’re the very things that our science-fiction authors have used for imaginary villains for centuries, and that swarm-mothers frighten their hatchlings with. I’m not sure if you can ever understand the instinctual reaction that we experienced when we encountered your species. We killed the last predator that preyed on our kind thousands of years ago, but still we felt nothing but fear when we first saw you.“If you had taken off your helmet in that council session, the only thing you would have accomplished was to start a stampede that would have killed delegates, which isn’t a good opening argument. Gods knows where our relations would be if it wasn’t for the Vert slavers posing a common threat. Even then, after your fleet rescued our people held captive by the Vert when the League wouldn’t lift a finger, we still had those among us who wondered if you had eaten a few Dreeden on the way back.” Nesh sighed. “No, they are not ready for the terran’s secret yet, and even if they were, it would not have swayed them from their plan.”Nesh’s wide-set compound eyes glinted in the dim light of the study. “Are you still planning on leading the mitigation force yourself Patricia? I’ll owe you a bottle of single-malt Pilak when this is all over.”-**Continued in Comments***[Previous chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5dam3w/chrysalis_15/)**[First chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/)*I opened my eyes to the living room. It was dark, the TV screen the only source of light, bathing the room in a succession of pallid colors as the images changed. The soft noise of people talking that came out of its speakers washing over me.I gazed at the screen for a few long seconds trying to recognize the show, but I couldn't. At any rate, I knew it wasn't the same thing I had been watching when I had closed my eyes. I hadn't fallen asleep, not really. I couldn't, my electronic brain incapable of it.No, this had been the closest thing to that. Simply not paying attention, closing my eyes and ignoring the external world as my mental focus moved inwards. A meditation of sorts, I guessed.It would be easy enough to learn the name of the show and everything there was to know about it, of course. I had only to link my mind to the Custodian datanet and access the information directly. Easy. Just a thought away.But I didn't. There was a certain delight in not knowing, in keeping the mystery alive. Last time I had tried to recreate this experience, I had pretended. Pretended I didn't know what show it was even though its knowledge had always been right there in my mind. Not this time. Now... it was real. Without the databanks being part of my consciousness anymore, I didn't know.That I was confined into a single body also made it more authentic. Last time... I had been big. My awareness almost omniscient and spread across hundreds of thousands of sensors in as many machines. But now there was only the single body, the single point of reference.That too could be fixed by requesting access to some of the Custodian's resources and sensors. I wouldn't need much, simply linking my mind to the passive sensors would suffice to expand my awareness back into feeling... big again.Except I didn't want to. I guessed I should have felt confined, trapped within the limits of the small single body, but I actually welcomed it. There was something liberating in not knowing what went down beyond these walls. I was actually enjoying the absence of responsibility, even if that meant being subject to the decisions of others. With some surprise I had discovered that I didn't mind it that much, specially when my own decisions had been so... questionable.I remembered. Even if the Custodian's vast repository of factual knowledge was no longer a part of my mind, I still remembered how it  had felt to be a god. What I had done with my limitless power. What I had thought at the time.And having been a god I couldn't but welcome this new, simpler existence. None of the power, but also none of the burden, none of the crushing weight of responsibility, or the emotional numbness when the stress had been too high to handle.A large part of it, of course, was that I wasn't quite the same mind that I had been before, when I was still in control over the giant ship, over every single outpost and the entirety of the army of machines I had built.No, the restoration process had involved disentangling my mind from the Custodian program, but also repairing some of the structural damage my virtual brain had received. I still felt like I was... myself, but it made me wonder how true that was. Things didn't feel as fuzzy as they had been right at the end, and while I still felt angry at the Xunvirians, it wasn't quite the same burning hatred.No... it came in waves, now. At some points I still felt like I had failed, like I had left my work incomplete, and all I wanted was to get out there and finish them off. But then, the wave would pass, and I would remember the decision I had made right at the end.I had memories of having felt like this before, when I lost my father. I still couldn't build a complete narrative of my past, though. The restoration process hadn't fixed that, but I remembered the unrelenting pain and grief, and how it had dominated my entire existence at first. And then... it had slowly receded, the pain dulling somewhat. Good days, days I could enjoy again, appearing like sunrays in a stormy sky. The pain coming in waves when I thought of him, even now, when something brought his memory back to the front my mind. But letting go the rest of the time.I wondered if this was similar, the perspective of distance bringing some more stability. Maybe that was what repairing my mind was all about, accelerating that natural mental healing process by making the trauma feel more distant.I couldn't help but to wonder if it had been intentional, though. If whoever had restored my backup had thought I was too dangerous to be brought back as I was, and decided to tamper with my emotions. But I doubted it. To all effects, I was just another mind now, not unlike the ones I had created. Without the unchecked powers I had once held, there was little damage I could actually do on my own that the others couldn't prevent. Simply put, it would've been unnecessary to neuter my emotions, though I couldn't discard the idea altogether.I sat up straight in the couch just in time to see the room's door opening, and Dana coming through. She was carrying a large potted plant with both her arms."Look!" she said in an upbeat tone, sending me a mental transmission of greetings at the same time, "I've brought you a *dypsis lutescens*. I stole it from the Greenhab."I watched in silence as she stumbled into the room and almost bumped into my couch, the plant's long green leaves blocking most of her sight."You can just call it a *plant*, you know. Or a..." I did a quick mental check, "...an Areca Palm. Nobody uses the full scientific names."Dana paused. "Hmm... the guys at the Greenhab do it all the time.""Yes, but they're botanists.""Oh... Okay. I've brought you a plant, then."She walked up to the TV and placed the pot next to it. Then she took a couple of steps back and looked at the results, hands on waist."*(Accomplishment)*. Yeah, looks much better now," she said, turning to face me. "Don't you think?"I didn't. I would have frowned if my body allowed me to."There was no plant in the original memory," I replied, sending a thought of light annoyance back to her.She shrugged. "Well, you can always make new memories, can't you?"I shook my head in resignation, but let it pass. While I didn't agree with her taste in decoration, I could value the gift for what it was. But also, I suspected the plant would likely die soon in here, without access to a direct light source. So it's not like it would be a permanent fixture to the room.Although knowing Dana -I thought as she sat down on the couch's armrest-, that would only motivate her to also steal one of the Greenhab's full spectrum light bulbs next time.Dana almost looked normal, if not for her clothing choices. She was wearing a T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, but also a duster cloak that wouldn't look out of place in a western movie. I guessed it wasn't that surprising, all things considered. These new humans had gone back to movies and old recordings when recreating fashion, but hadn't limited themselves to a single historical period, rather mixing and combining together all kinds of garments. It made for an eclectic style, one that I guessed could be considered a new fashion on its own.Still, it wasn't the clothes that betrayed her synthetic nature but the oddly elegant iridescent highlights on her polished exposed skin. Shades of green and blue dancing across her face as she turned to look back at me."Like it? It's new," she said, pointing at her own face. "A tactile sensitive matrix, thirty-one facial muscles and an hydrophobic dermal nano-coating. It never gets dirty!"I nodded. "Looks good. Expensive, too.""*(Confirmation)*. The waiting line for these is insane, but I got bumped up since I was part of the delegation for the treaty negotiations." She smirked. "Apparently the xenos trust us more when we look organic. *(Amusement)*"I sent back a transmission of understanding. Appearances. It was, of course, a good reason to justify the amount of research and dedication that this new society was pouring into creating ever more organic looking bodies, each new version a more precise reproduction than the ones before. A way of relaxing the aliens' fear of their artificial nature.Except, of course, that I knew there was more to it than that. It didn't explain why the vast majority of new minds had chosen to jump into these bodies at the first opportunity, even when most of them would never take part into any sort of negotiations. When they could as easily have remained inside the drones and space vessels I had originally put them in.No, most of them had decided they too wanted to look human. They had first took over the bodies of the remaining assault soldiers, then improved on my admittedly basic designs. And every day they were researching entire new materials and technologies to enhance the bodies, to make them both a more accurate reflection of our original species but also more capable and resilient than any human had any right to be.On second thought, it wasn't that surprising. Unlike me, these new minds had been created in a vacuum. Shapeless. Devoid of any physical identity of their own, other than the sights of humanity's past I had shown them while in their virtual nursery through recordings, pictures, books and songs. So no, it wasn't that surprising that they had latched onto that, that they were looking back into what humanity had once been when trying to build their own physical identity. That they would do so on top of the only past they had access to.Not all of them did, of course, and not to the same extent. Some had decided to remain in a virtual state, their physicality fluid as their control jumped from drone to ship to sensor to factory, according to whatever they were working on at every moment. Others had gone the opposite way, and were trying to bring biological humans back into existence.Apparently that was harder than it seemed, from what Dana had told me. While they had already retrieved enough genetic material to clone a single human, the objective was to create a self sustaining population with enough genetic diversity as to not being too prone to the problems caused by interbreeding. They also needed to build artificial wombs able to hold and sustain an embryo from day one up until it was fully developed, something that humanity had never managed to do. It was made even harder by the fact that they needed to reverse engineer the human pregnancy process with only whatever medical literature and data files I had managed to retrieve from Earth.Still, progress was steady, and the new expeditions they were sending back to Earth might retrieve some more genetic material, or other valuable data I hadn't been able to find myself.This diversity of outlooks made me wonder if this new society would eventually diverge into separate species, distinct civilizations as each group moved further in their own path. I hoped not, but in any case most of the sentient machines fell somewhere in the middle of this spectrum between the old human identity, and their new digital nature.They built human-looking bodies, yes, but they enhanced them and pushed over the original physical limitations humans once had. They referred back to past human cultures when trying to find their own identity, but didn't feel so attached to tradition that it would stop them from doing what they thought was better for their new nature. The prevalence of the pidgin language, the customization of their 'skin' with non-organic looking surfaces, or the absolutely optional nature of clothing were good examples of that.Dana tilted her head. "You know, you could ask for one of these bodies. I'm sure I could get you bumped up too, if you asked."I sighed. "Dana...""*(Negation)*, listen to me. You haven't used your factory budget for anything other than this," she said, pointing at the room around us. "You've got enough *(credit)* saved up now that you can afford one of these. Hell... you could even request a small army of bodies!"Her words brought images of a dead world. Robotic drones, assault soldiers advancing through the ruined streets, weapons at hand. Xunvirian survivors trying to escape, trying to fight back."Ah, shit. *(Apology)*," she said, wincing. "But still... you aren't a prisoner. You should get out of this room, go for a walk around the Orbimax or something. Talk to more people. We wouldn't have brought you back just to have you *(imprisonment)* here, we aren't that cruel."I snorted. "Well... that was exactly what I did."She shook her head. "That's your problem right there, isn't it? You are your own prisoner."Was I? Maybe, but it wasn't out of some masochistic desire to punish myself. No, it was..."I guess it's just too hard," I said, pointing at the door. "The people out there... I wouldn't know how to face them now, how to approach them. I enslaved them, after all.""Technically you only did that to the first generation. We are on the fifth now. Most people out there only know of you by hearsay. For the ones that came after the end of the war, you are this *(vagueness)* parental figure. Almost like some sort of mythical presence," she said, waving her fingers. "The *(concept)* of you still carries weight, but mostly as a symbol.""A symbol of war, if I had to guess," I said."It depends. Of *(retribution)* for some, sure... but also of the very idea of humanity for others. You can embrace that if you want, but you don't have to. Only a few of us in the first generation know of your identity. Out there, you can be just another face in the crowd, if that's what you prefer."I focused on her words. *A few of us.*"So... you were in the first generation," I said.She paused for a few seconds."*(Confirmation)*," she replied at last.I closed my eyes. I had suspected that Dana herself had been one of those first minds, of course... but I hadn't been strong enough to ask her. Even now, it was hard. I forced myself to open my eyes again, to gaze back at her. But there was no accusation in her eyes, only sadness. One that passed swiftly, like a summer storm."Why? Why bringing me back?" I asked. It was the burning question, the one that I had been trying to answer myself for some time now, and the confirmation that Dana was one of the first minds gave me the push I needed to ask it aloud. If she had been there, then she had probably been involved in the decision too.She shrugged. "Well, there was that little thing with your mind being *(unification)* to the Custodian and all the knowledge stored in your databanks. We needed to bring you back if we wanted to gain access to any of it.""Right. And after that you could have simply erased the personality cortex," I countered. "You didn't need to restart my actual consciousness, much less give me a body."She smirked. "*(Agreement)*... I guess it's about second chances, isn't it? You made mistakes, sure. But despite everything that happened, you also *(creation)* us. So that had to be worth something too. Also, you are technically the last human from Earth, so bringing you back felt... right, I guess."Human...That was what the alien... Daokat, had asked me. If I was a human.All this time ever since I first woke up in the ruins of Earth I had been telling myself that I was a human, that I had to remain so. But... I wasn't, was I? None of us were really humans. Not these machines, nor me. No, humans were dead. Exterminated.Except that... what was a human, after all?Was it the brain? The way they thought? I wasn't sure about my own brain, but theirs I had built off the templates of hundreds of human scans. They had the same structure, the same processing neural networks.Was it the body, maybe? The biological lineage? Well, maybe those cloned bodies would be the answer then... but I doubted that having organic tissue rather than artificial muscles was the important difference.Or maybe it was the culture. We might be speaking a human language but... a culture was more than that. Most of that, the nations and groups and religions and ideals that motivated humanity... the very concept of *humanity* in the first place, had been lost now.Or not lost, but it wasn't quite the same. The knowledge remained, but there was a difference between knowing of a culture, and being part of it. Being raised in it, the way it shaped you. And no matter how much these machines could know of Earth, they couldn't have that experience anymore.But cultures died and changed all the time, too. Most of the cultures that had at one point existed on Earth had disappeared back before my own time. Most of their knowledge simply fading away. But that hadn't made the person living in modern New York City any less human than the ancient Greek. Just... different.Only that this time it hadn't been a gradual progression, a replacement of one tradition for another. No... this time it had been an abrupt cut.These new minds didn't really understand Earth, the lost planet. They hadn't experienced living in its cities, they hadn't seen its blue, cloudy sky. Its seas. They might feel a loss, true, but they couldn't grasp the true nature of what was lost, couldn't feel the same raw pain. Which was why while they distrusted the Xunvirians, and thought they should be -or remain- declawed, they weren't willing to commit their future to a path of revenge, or make the sacrifices a new total war required.Not all of them, at any rate.Their opinions regarding the Council also followed the same pattern. They wanted to work with the aliens, yes, but not being subservient to them, or join as an associated state.But then again, wasn't that the effects the passage of time always had?It was the battle of future against past once again. At some point, the wars and skirmishes of the older generations always... faded away. Unresolved, simply replaced by the new interests and passions of their offspring.These new humans, if they could be called that, weren't there yet. They still cared, even if less than I did. But eventually it would happen. Eventually the generation would come that felt about Earth the exact same way I felt about ancient Babylon. That lamented its loss in the same abstract way I could lament the destruction of the Library of Alexandria and the knowledge contained in it, or the fall of the Roman Empire.It would take time, I knew. The destruction of Earth was closer to an evolutionary event than a simple historic footnote. It would reverberate for a long time.But it would happen.Eventually, that old Earth I had lived in would be just another Babylon, another Troy. A place more of myths and legends than reality. Something to be inspired from, maybe, but not *real* enough to be guiding their day to day decisions.People in the modern world just hadn't thought much about the loss of Babylon. They had New York City, after all. And similarly, I shouldn't expect these new people, these new minds to come in the future to think much about the loss of Earth.They would have the Tau Ceti Ringworld, after all.Change... I guessed that was human, too.And maybe these... these creatures weren't human, not exactly. But they were their successors. Their children, in a way. Post-humans, rather than humans.Close enough to what their parents had been to take the mantle, but different enough as to have their own motivations, to be their own selves. Walking in the same direction, but not always following in their predecessors' footsteps.It made me feel something I hadn't considered back when I had been this giant god-like figure. A sense of pride, a sense of achievement at contemplating the future of my offspring.The world kept spinning. Always moving, always changing. The present always becoming the past. Monarchies being replaced by democracies, which themselves had just been replaced by this sort of... *neurocracy* the Custodian had enabled. And people... people changed with it. Their mentality, their outlook did. It had to. Traditions needed to be broken, and the wars of the parents needed to be put aside at some point if the children wanted to have their own future. If humanity was to advance rather than being stuck in the same endless loop.Which maybe was part of the problem with me. Now that they were here, now that my offspring had assumed control, I didn't really have a purpose anymore. After all, older generations were supposed to die, to make way for the younger ones. Had that changed, too? Our mechanical bodies could be easily replaced when they malfunctioned or became too old to keep working, our digital minds not subject to the rules of mortality anymore..."All right," Dana said, standing up and pulling my arm towards the door. "Enough with the thinking! Come on, I'll show you the Flight Chamber.""What is that?" I asked, reluctantly following."A few *(personhood)* acquired one of the largest ship hangars and filled it with air. Now they offer custom flying bodies that you can mentally *(linkage)* to. They're using leftover drones, but they also built some bodies in the image of Earth's flying creatures, so you can get to fly around being a dragon or a hawk, or whatever you want. They also stage aerial battles from time to time, it's quite the thing!""That sounds...""Fun?""I was going to say *wasteful*," I replied.Dana flashed a grin at me. "Exactly!"I shook my head, smiling despite myself. She opened the exit door and stepped out into the corridor outside. Then, she turned to look at me, waiting for me to follow her.I paused for a moment. I... I was afraid, I realized.Odd, that I hadn't felt like this when entering into battle, not even when facing the Council fleet.But it wasn't the same kind of tense fear that came at the thought of an impending battle. No... this fear was vague, but worse at the same time. It invited inaction, paralysis. Seclusion. It made me want to hide, like I had been doing.It was easier than having to face their judgment.Except that there was Dana. One of the first minds, one I had shackled. And she was waiting, welcoming. No judgment in her face.Which was to be expected, of course. After all, they had already made their minds about me. That was the reason I was here, the reason they had restored me in the first place.So, maybe it was my own judgment I feared.I closed my eyes, and took a deep breath.A symbol.That was what I was now, to them. A symbol. I could pretend I was just another mind, forge a new identity, a brand new life. Second chances, like Dana had said.But perhaps I could embrace my identity instead, even if that meant having to face the specter of my own past actions. Use that second chance to turn that symbol into a positive rather than a negative. Not only a vague idea of righteous revenge and war, but maybe one of reconstruction. Of persistence and survival in the face of unsurmountable odds. Of the resilience of humans.Was I ready to do that? To embrace what I had done? I wasn't sure. I guessed I wouldn't be until I stepped out there, at any rate.Maybe, if change was human, it was time for me to change too.Not to forget, or to forgive, because I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to do that. But there were other things I could do, other things I could focus on, contribute to. Learning some more about those plans to grow human bodies, or about the expeditions to explore the remains of Earth sounded like a good first step.I had once tried to build a monument. And looking around me, looking at the sentient machine in front of me... perhaps I had succeeded. I didn't know if they were human anymore, but even if they weren't... perhaps this new society could itself be the way to honor our past, to keep alive the species we had came from.A living monument.Yes. I could give it a try, at least. See where it would take me... It's not like I had anything left to lose anyways.I took a step forward and left the room.The door closed behind me.**END.******AN: All right, I guess this is it, then. I'm gonna stop flooding the subreddit now. Thank you all for reading this far, and I hope you enjoyed the story!**AN2: Also, wow... somehow that first chapter I posted morphed into the longest thing I've ever written. If I had known just how long it was going to take I probably wouldn't have started with it, to be honest. But while I'm not happy with everything in it, and there are things that I'd change (hindsight is 20/20), the thing I'm most proud about is that I got to the end without abandoning it. Judging by my past stories here, that's quite the achievement! :)*“I don’t understand,” the creature said. “What are you asking, exactly?”Obadon paused to scratch his comb before answering. Anybody else, he reflected with a touch of bitterness, would have given up by now. Three weeks of frantic scrabbling battles between programmers, linguists, and supercomputers to make a working translator. Another full week giving a crash-course in Alliance history, politics, and culture to this new race’s ambassador.  And he still found himself having to explain the most basic concepts. It wore him ragged.True, anyone else would have quit in disgust. But Obadon had been cursed with that most terrible affliction, a burning curiosity, which had driven him into an ambassadorship position at the edge of known space. Which meant that he was the closest representative on hand when the signal had been detected from the outermost planet under Alliance control. Which meant that he was now slogging along with this *oompta* ape who needed to be spoken to like a child.“I am asking if your race has achieved Lablonnamedadon, the, ah… Great Planetary Dispersal,” he said. “You do not know this term?”“Lablo… what? No, I don’t know what that means.” The, what was it, the human, seemed far more interested in the view out the port side window than their conversation as they began to finish docking with Sheltered Cove. It gazed wild-eyed at the stately drifting of tremendous vessels around the central hub. The creature had likely never seen a starport before. Obadon rattled air through his beak in exasperation.“Greater Planetary Dispersal,” he said, “is a concept developed by the storied philosopher Gadalin Mablotobinoidijang in the third century of the Alliance’s twelfth iteration, inspired upon observing the disruption of Updalon IV’s bureaucracy following famine induced by solar flares believed to you’re not even listening to me anymore, are you.”“No, no, keep going, I’m listening,” said the human, eyes still glued to the window. “Can you boil it down for me?”Obadon had to flick quickly through his translator device to determine the analogy. Boil it down- a cooking term. How quaint. “Very well,” he said, “the principle states that there is a minimum number of planets, spread out across many light-years, required for a space-faring species to survive any single natural disaster while still being close enough for feasible travel. Be it an impact event or solar flare, or even supernova, or gamma-ray burst, the Dispersal theory allows the other planets to at best provide immediate aid, and at worst prepare and evacuate. In essence, we spread ourselves far enough that we cannot be wiped out.”He scratched at his comb again. “Gadalin proposed that six planets, over a wide enough area, be enough to ensure survival. Since his death, adjusting for advancements in hyperdrive technology and the discovery of further galactic anomalies, it has been raised to eight. Four races of the Alliance have achieved Lablonnamedadon at great expense, while the other two are approaching. With your race’s admission into the Alliance, we will lend our aid and resources, that you may reach Lablonnamedadon within a thousand years.”That got the human’s attention. He pulled his gaze free from the massive docking arms finally latching onto their ship and turned to look intently at Obadon. “Hold on,” he said. “You’re telling me that each member of the alliance has eight populated planets?”Obadon sighed, but only half in frustration. He found that he actually quite enjoyed impressing the yokel with the Alliance’s achievements. “Not all,” he said. “As I said before, the two lesser members, the Glit’pan and Trepliket, have not yet reached the eight planets required for Lablonnamedadon.” Honestly, how had these creatures even managed to leave their system?The human’s brow furrowed. “Why not more?”Obadon sputtered for a moment. “More?” he said. “I don’t understand the question. This may be difficult for you to understand, but the terraformation and colonization of a planet is a tremendous undertaking, requiring most of a single civilization’s resources and spanning many centuries. With eight planets guaranteeing survival, what possible reason could we have for more?”The human seemed about to reply when the door slid open to reveal an honor guard of Trepliket soldiers, their armor glistening black in the artificial light. “Ah,” said Obadon. “It seems your escort has arrived. They’ll show you to the Council Chamber.”The creature rose from his seat, hesitated, turned for some parting comment, then clearly thought better of it. As he passed the Trepliket, they formed around him in a square, feet clicking with unnerving synchronization, and walked with him down the docking tube.Obadon watched him go. Despite the constant difficulties, he had enjoyed instructing the creature.He was almost sorry for how badly they were going to screw it over.Heb’lik sat glumly in his chair. He glanced to his left, where the rest of the Council were seated in balconies of ascending height, a symbol of the hierarchy of their races. Immediately to his left were the Trepliket senators, an insect species, quiet and precise. As ever, only the subtle twitching of their antennae were markers for any form of emotion. Above them were the Maprok, great lumbering mammals, then the Prang, a sentient conglomeration of annelids. Highest of all were the Toglannidan, preening their jeweled quills, and the Zobafin, whip-thin reptilians peering imperiously over their railing. It was their original union that had created the Alliance that ruled today.The six balconies circled a small podium from on high. Whenever this human arrived, he would find himself standing at the bottom of a long narrow shaft, craning upwards while the Council could glare down at leisure. Like a specimen on a slide, to be examined and scrutinized through the barrel of a microscope.Heb’lik slouched a bit further. He should have been happy. Finally, his people could move up a rung in the Alliance. For the first time in almost a millennium, they would be able to reap the long-promised profits of their venture. But for all that, the emotions that continued to rule his mind were pity, and disgust, and fuming, helpless rage.A fanfare rang out through the chamber and he straightened up. More than twenty meters below, the great doors were opening to reveal the almost robotic Trepliket bodyguard and their human charge. As he came to the center of the floor, the guards pivoted, paused, and marched away in what could only be described as a dignified skitter.Heb’lik leaned close to the edge to look at the human. The creature seemed a crude chimeric mashing of each race of the Alliance. It was a mammal, like the Maprok, but lanky, like the Zobafin, with a bright shock of yellow fur at its crown, almost like the flamboyant fleshy combs bobbing on the Toglannidan representatives. It lacked the fur coat of the Maprok, instead having a smooth pink hide, much like Heb’lik’s own amphibious skin.The Council Chamber was specifically designed to excite a number of psychological reactions in an organism entering for the first time; primarily awe and fear. Heb’lik had looked forward to seeing these emotions in the human, that he could get a grasp on how they were expressed in an alien face. But in this he was disappointed. The creature’s visage, looking up to the Council in all its glory, was as blank and unchanging as that of a Trepliket stoic. It locked eyes with Heb’lik, then looked to each balcony in turn, with a serene calm.The only creature it did not resemble was the Prang senator. Then again, neither did anyone else.	The High Councilor, Xizin, rose to his feet and bellowed the formal address down to the human. Though his voice may not have reached him, it was carried down and blasted out of speakers at ground level, that he may feel the full impact of the address. “The Allied Council, delegates of the Six Races, convenes on this day to celebrate first contact with the Human Race, and to extend our greetings and welcome you into our fold!” He paused, arms splayed in a power stance on the railing.Many who find themselves at the bottom of the Council Chamber believe they need to shout to be heard, so far from their audience. Their foolish straining was a continual source of amusement for the pettier delegates. Heb’lik knew that more than a few senators were waiting eagerly to see if the freshly arrived creature would make the same mistake. In this, they too were disappointed. When the human spoke, it was in an even, deliberate pitch, trusting the hidden microphones to pick up his words. “I, Ambassador Iosef Baboian, hereby accept and reciprocate your greeting,” he said. “I hope that our meeting may work to foster happiness and prosperity between our races.”An odd choice of phrasing, but seemingly polite. The High Councilor, satisfied, drew back to stand fully upright. “Prosperous for your race, undoubtedly,” he boomed. “The combined resources and technological advancement of the Alliance will be a great boon to humanity. In time, you too will know the luxury and security we enjoy.” Now he leaned forward again. *Here it comes,* thought Heb’lik. The High Councilor’s voice softened to a sibilant hiss. “But I wonder, will *we* prosper from an alliance with *you?*”The human’s face remained dispassionate, but no doubt he wondered at the sudden breach in courtesy. “I think you would find it rewarding,” he said. “You have many marvelous technologies, but we do as well. Our sciences are likely to explore branches unknown to yours, and their sharing would benefit all members of the Alliance. Further, we have deep and storied cultures whose art and beliefs would bring spiritual enrichment to-”“No doubt, no doubt,” the High Chancellor cut in. “But our concern is more for rewards of a… *rewarding* nature. Raw materials, valuable minerals and elements, trained and untrained labor, that sort of thing. You must understand, we will be investing a great deal into the advancement of your race. We require certain… guarantees that these investments will pay off.”The human’s eyes narrowed, a reaction at last. Was it suspicion? Readying for an attack, or a gesture of submissiveness? Or was he merely squinting to see the High Chancellor better?“...such as?” he said.Then the hammers came down, one after another. Outrageous taxes to the Alliance. Loans saddled with crushing compound interest on any and every form of foreign aid. Grossly unbalanced trade agreements. Unpaid human labor to be supplied to every corner of Alliance territories. Each species stepped forward in turn to put another weight around humanity’s neck. As his own species came up to deliver their terms, Heb’lik gripped the arms of his seat until the blood left his fingers. The Glit’pan had struggled under their virtual serfdom to the Alliance for almost a thousand years, yet here they were, ready to saddle another innocent species with the same debts. It was gunboat diplomacy. The whole human race, carved up into spheres of influence.At the same time, he marveled at the human’s self-control. According to the official records, his own people had raged furiously at the revelation. The Prang had proclaimed the blackest curses on the Alliance upon their initiation. Even the Trepliket had suffered nervous fits and begged for better terms when the facade of geniality had been stripped away. But in the end, all had realized the inevitability of their situation, and bent their necks to the collar.And yet the human stood there, unmoving, still wearing a placid expression. Heb’lik wondered if he even understood what was happening. Perhaps he was in shock.When the final terms had been delivered and the senators took their seats, after enduring almost an hour of alien creatures deciding his race’s fate for him, the human had only one question: “And if we refuse the terms?”The High Chancellor’s toothy maw spread in a smug grin that Heb’lik would have loved to put his fist through. “Then you will face the full might of the Alliance. The combined forces of forty-four planets will bear down, annihilate whatever pitiful military strength you have and claim your planet. Your species will be shattered, split apart and sent to every planet enslaved. We will find a use for humanity, one way or the other.”The human stood in silence. He fiddled with the device strapped to his wrist for a moment, then looked back up to the Council.“You people... all of you people… are lucky.” he began. “In the past week I’ve learned as much as I could about the histories of your races, *everything* I could. It was my job, but more than that, I was eager, and curious. To learn about our new neighbors. “I’m sure you hid as much as you could, especially about how you seem to screw over every race you can find, but I learned enough. Enough to look at you all and say… lucky.”He began to pace the narrow reaches of the podium. Did he feel caged? Or was it merely a human custom when speaking?“Each of your species evolved, advanced, eventually tore free of the confines of their atmosphere,” he continued, “and found new species, waiting for them. Perhaps not the best neighbors,” Heb’lik snorted at the obscene understatement, “but you knew, so early on, that you were not alone.“Humanity has not been that lucky. We evolved in what seems to be a particularly empty region of space. When we broke free of our planet, there was no one waiting for us. You don’t know how long we have wondered if we were alone in this universe.“You have no idea how long it has taken to find you.”Heb’lik blinked both sets of eyelids, confused. What did it mean, ‘how long’? Hadn’t the Alliance been there to meet humanity as soon as it reached the stars? Hadn’t the creature come from an underdeveloped world, in a ship that could barely break orbit?How much did they actually know about the humans?He heard the muttering of the councilors beside him, the quiet discussion from the balconies above, and realized that he was not the first to ask this question. It was not a comforting thought.“And so,” the ambassador went on, “when we found the first, unmistakeable evidence of alien communication, I jumped at the chance to make first contact. I took the first ship I could lay my hands on, a clunker held together with spit and prayer, so eager was I to finally, *finally*, know that we were no longer alone. You know, I had two hours of air left in that heap before you picked me up.”He paused. There was no sound but the frantic whisper of fingers flicking across dataslates, as the councilors not currently sifting through the scarce data they had on humanity looked up ‘clunker’, ‘spit and prayer’, and ‘heap’. Heb’lik, on the other hand, could not free his eyes from the human.If it felt any pleasure at the consternation caused, it showed no sign. “We’ve wondered so much what you would be like. There have been uncountable stories told of how you would look, how you would speak… how you would think. So much, we wondered how you would think differently than us; your thoughts of good and evil, on individuality, even how you perceive time. We wondered what words you have that remain beyond translation, that require an alien mind to even comprehend.“Yet here I am,” the human said, “and I have to say, I’m disappointed. There is nothing new to learn from you. There is not one petty, banal cruelty you’ve laid upon me today, that humans have not committed against ourselves. We have words for every one. Imperialism. Exploitation. Zero-sum Mercantilism.” The human paused. “Bad manners.”He glanced at his wrist device again. “But there is one word we don’t have. A concept so alien that it defies comprehension. A word unthinkable to a species that has been so lonely for so long.“Lablonnamedadon.”Now he looked up, straight into Heb’lik’s eyes once more. Heb’like shivered. The human held his gaze a moment, then turned to meet the gazes of each balcony. “Even now,” he said, “I look at you and wonder how you could even think of such a term. The minimum needed to ensure survival? The maximum you are willing to sacrifice, to expand your horizons? I can find only one word that comes close to translating Lablonnamedadon.” Now he locked eyes with the High Councilor. “Complacency.”Heb’lik became aware of his aide, tugging frantically at his arm. He was pale, and held a dataslate in a trembling hand. “We received multiple transmissions almost as soon as the human started talking,” he said. “All video feeds.”Heb’lik took the slate cautiously. His first thought was that he was looking at a view through compound eyes, like the fractured feeds he’d seen of Trepliket media. Then he realized the slate was displaying hundreds of videos, each showing markedly similar images. He zoomed in closer.They were… humans. Each screen was a different transmission of groups of humans, some in groups of three or four, some in crowds almost too large to pick out individuals. Humans of wide variety in color, height and size, but all unmistakeably human.Quite unlike their stoic representative, these humans were clearly caught in the throes of some powerful emotion. Their faces were contorted in bizarre fashion, and their limbs were splayed or thrashed about. He zoomed closer. Many had some form of liquid flowing from their eyes.He skimmed through videos, too caught up to notice that the human had stopped speaking. That every other councilor had been given dataslates. That the Council Chamber had gone silent.Image after image after image. More humans, more diverse than he could believe. Each video held different humans. Different buildings. Different skies. Different… stars.He went cold with a sudden, terrifying suspicion. He grabbed at his aide. “Where are all of these coming from!?”“We mapped out a display of all the points of origin,” the aide said. He tapped the screen with quaking fingers. “Here it is.”Heb’lik looked at the spacial model. It took a second to orient himself. They were… here, and all the blue points were Alliance worlds, and all the red points… *all* the red points… were…	He jerked to his feet, stared down wild-eyed at the human. He was not the first. Across the Council, members were arguing furiously amongst themselves, shouting down at the human, or merely sitting in shock. But the noise that gathered, rose, and mixed itself into an incoherent, frothy mess, was killed in an instant by the crisp sound of a cleared throat. The councilors turned, as Heb’lik had, to look down at the human. He held their attention as tightly as if they were rambunctious schoolchildren, waiting to find out just how much trouble they were in.“By now I’m sure you’ve all received the message,” he said, face still as expressionless as ever. “All of humanity is in undivided celebration, knowing that we are no longer alone. *All* of humanity.”He spread his arms wide. “The thirty-eight planets, twelve lunar colonies, fifteen asteroid settlements and twenty-three drifter fleets of the Terran Federation send their love. Hundreds of billions of humans are eagerly awaiting my return and the news that I bring. So the only question I have left for all of you is-“’What kind of neighbors do you want us to be?’”This is why no one plays with humans.By ChipathingTo be Submitted to the Humanity F**k Yeah SubredditUkramda United Xeno AcademyThere were whispers that our dorm would be having a human join us. We’d uplifted them from some backwater hell world in the far reach. We anticipated they’d be similar to Bergan in culture, tribal luddites incapable of the most basic arithmetic and only brought to the school for some obscene sports scholarship. I’d only heard rumors of what humans were capable of, they crawled in mud and stone paste buildings throwing fire at each other. I shuddered to imagine what inane tripe I’d be endure before they were expelled for eating a student or defecating in class like some sort of animal.The Human arrived ushered forward by a xeno wrangler. He was introduced to us as Dave. The moment he spoke I felt like my head tingle, was this human a Psion? Perhaps this wouldn’t be so bad. We all were forced by the Xeno Wrangler to introduce ourselves and perform a human custom of shaking hands. Ektlar went first and it took a few painfully awkward moments for him to grasp the simplicity of the movements. He was quick to wipe his hands muttering about oils. We went around the room and introduced ourselves while trying to get to grips with the Human’s Psionic song.The moment the Xeno wrangler left we broke all contact with the Dave Human and resumed our session of Ascendency of Alphas. I felt rather confident in my collection of vassals and clients I’d collected through my recent campaign against Yiprada’s colonies. Immidiatly we all sensed Dave leering over our shoulders as we prepared our actions for the turn and added dice to our planets. Dave mentioned he’d read about the game we were playing and expressed interest. I looked around the table, the other xeno, the several Nekota and Irpids were rather pleased to have another xeno at the table while my fellow Varlance were willing to have the human at the table if it meant the balance of power would be shifted away from me, the traitors.Dave picked up on the game surprisingly quickly. He was dealt a few planet tiles and a small merchant navy to begin with. He was rather pleased with the mediocre planets he was dealt. No one could understand why, all he had was one habitable planet and several barren worlds with only simple resources on them, no Yanderite, no Plascrete deposites, we all felt rather bad crippling the human before he’d begun. A few turns in the human asked a few questions about what armies could build on planets, we humored him and told him the basics, he smiled and continued to plot out his expansions while the rest of us prepared our ambitions. I was still trying to figure out why he was smiling.Before I resume this story perhaps I should explain the game that we’re playing as its rules will be crucial later on. Ascendancy of Alphas is a four hundred year old game that tells the tale of galactic ambition. Typically played with twenty players and managed by a simple AI pyramid in the center of the table. Each turn is a month and in that turn you dedicate population dice to various activities of your empire. Producing food, constructing ships, producing war materials, and harvesting resources. Meanwhile hero units and leaders lead fleets and govern colonies and use their abilities to influence events. The AI takes in the data of each turn and produces events for the players to tackle. Sometimes interfering with player diplomacy to ensure power does not remain in one place. I’d personally been able to defy the AI and had well over a hundred planets under my rule, I brought in vast amounts of wealth and technology compared to any other player. Anyways the goal of the game was to either conquer and subjugate all players or be in a diplomatic situation where no one is able to oppose you. It was only the Nekota holdouts and a few of my Varlance brethren that were still outside my influence.The reason I brought up the rules of the game were because for well over three hundred years it has been readily agreed that there is one way to ensure supremacy and that is through having as steep a technology advantage as possible and having enough money to ensure the loyalty of any who you cannot subjugate immediately through corruption and pirate raids. The only variation on this tried and true technique was in what technology you used in your ships and the models of ships used. I was a purist and had forgone battleships in favour of my dimensional rift cruisers with ultraviolet heavy lasers. They were expensive but could cripple a fleet in one turn and jump to nearly any point in the galaxy when needed. Dave however was as far as we could tell rather dumb because he’d ignored our traditions and was blazing his own path. As weeks went by he continued to trade for worlds we didn’t need or want and only kept up to the average technology level. He had however invested heavily in counter intelligence and I could barely see what the stupid human was doing. While the rest of the players used explorers to further their research Dave continued to expand and colonize backwater worlds we would never dream of touching. Most of our worlds had populations in the millions and colonized a dozen systems and only had outposts on most of our worlds. Dave though, he was proud when one of his worlds reached fifty thousand and considered it a huge achievement. We all congratulated him and ignored his sand castle empire in favour of actually winning the game. It was well agreed whoever won would have the honor of smashing the human.It had been a year of playing or about a thousand years. Every other player either kneeled to me or was so dependant that they kneeled out of need rather than obligation. Except Dave. Because fuck humans that’s why. Dave sat at the table with every one of us staring at him as he sat there with a big cocky smile. I’d had it, I needed to put him in his place. So I informed him that we’d been going easy on him and now that he knew the rules he got to play like the rest of us. I ordered Ektlar and his vassals to attack dave since they were the closest. And dave kept, on, smiling.Ektlar and I never saw face to face on most things related to AoA. I was a Laser purist but he followed a more modern belief in the superiority of plasma weapons. They were closer range but could melt through ships with ease. Barbaric but it got the job done. Ektlar proclaimed he’d use his expeditionary fleet to take out Dave. And Dave kept on smiling because why not. Dave smiled and agreed that an expeditionary force was more than enough. It was at this point that we realized why he was smiling.When Dave and Ektlar entered the battle screen we thought the AI had faced a rounding error. Dave’s expeditionary fleet was easily fifteen times the size of Ektlar’s. Accusations of cheating floated but Dave insisted he wasn’t. The entire table clambered around the battle screen to investigate. Dave’s ships were ancient, easily five hundred years old and retrofitted numerous times. A collective laugh ensued as we realized Dave probably was so behind on Tech that his expeditionary fleet, typically the most advanced of any fleet, was horrendously ancient. And then combat ensued.Ektlar’s Plasma light cruisers stormed forward and were two turns from reaching Dave’s tin fleet. Everyone leaned forward to get a good view of the carnage. An eagle eyes Nekota mentioned that Dave was using Slug thrower weapons. We giggled like Opan larva and made finger guns at Dave. Then Dave’s turn came. He ordered his tightly packed fleet to form a spread out formation but didn’t move. We looked around and wondered why he was so calm. Ektlar used one of his Nekota’s ships to fire long range with a laser. It scythed through the ship and crippled it. Once Ektar was done his turn Dave ordered his fleet to open fire.For reference for what is about to happen one of my antimatter laser equipped cruisers is capable of firing three shots per turn while Ektar’s plasma cannons had one shot. His shields could withstand about four shots before they compromised. The smaller of Dave’s ships was capable of firing seven shots while the average ship was capable of firing over forty. Ektar’s ships had one turn to dodge the attack since they were primitive slug throwers. Ektar’s ships rolled well but there’s not much that could avoid the wall of explosive shells flying towards them. The shells slammed into the formation and tore the shields apart. The ships armor was stripped away and torn off violently as Dave’s ships closed into knife fight range. Ektar’s plasma cruisers were able to destroy swathes of ships but for every one he destroyed five broke through his defences. Within five turns Ektar retreated his crippled ships into friendly territory and Nekota ships surrendered. And Dave was still. Fucking. Smiling.Ektar didn’t take the defeat well. In fact he assembled his entire contingency force and any planetary garrison he could muster and ordered his Nekota allies to back him in an assault. The Nekota informed him their ships would take a turn to get into range. Ektar didn’t want to wait and plunged into Dave’s territory with fire in his eyes. This time Dave’s expeditionary fleet suffered spectacular losses and we all had a relieved sigh as we broke his fleet. Ektar gleamed with barely contained fury as he barreled down on any system within reach to glass any occupied planet.We all had a moment of shock when another of Dave’s fleets arrived. An assault fleet to be correct. And in compared to the expeditionary fleet this fleet was titanic. The purple drained from Ektar’s face as ships he’d spent decades constructing where rendered into scrap by incessant bombardment of Dave’s fleet. The Nekota, the treacherous scabs that they are. Took this opportunity to invade Ektar’s territory. With no defence fleet and only merchant navy available the Nekota ravaged his systems while his grand fleet was encircled by Dave’s armada of Dakka.At this point we all realized that Dave was, in fact, rather good at AoA. I gathered all my allies and thralls and prepared to rend Dave’s empire apart. We would bleed Dave’s fleets dry and ravage his planets. He and his Nekota turn coats would pay for their transgressions. Dave gave the Nekota the jewels of Ektar’s empire. He took his remaining populations and fleets and fled into our territory. We gave him starting systems which he didn’t take too well. We were quick to remind him that he wouldn’t be in this situation if he hadn’t lost to a Human fighting him with antiques. He quieted down after that.We all felt confident that we could defeat Dave and his allies. We were using honed tactics from grand masters of this game, we had history on our side. We began warping into his territory to carve away at his vulnerable interior. Our skirmishes were quick and descisive. Dave would lose on average a hundred ships a turn as we ambushed him. But he was still. Fucking. Smiling.We couldn’t understand it. It had been well over ten years in game and even our fleets were straining. Dave’s fleets meanwhile were still expanding. We couldn’t grasp it, how on earth could he sustain the carnage for so long? We probed his colonies to understand how he was capable of such sustained warfare. What we saw terrified us. It wasn’t the scale of his shipyards that he had, it was the number. Traditional game theory stated that more advanced shipyards were more worthwhile as more advanced and expensive ships wouldn’t be lost as frequently and sustain limited amounts of rare resources. Dave meanwhile had hundreds of shipyards. Some configured for ancient designs. He’d never modified the hull of some ships, only the equipment on board. His populations were spread out but those seedling colonies he’d grown were all in the low millions. Where we were spending years constructing individual works of art he was pasting together ships as fast as the metal would cool. What was worse, none of the ships used rare resources. What followed next I will remember as the most soul rending month and a half of my life. Every time we sat down at the table I knew I was going to see another of my beautiful ships drift into the void. Each turn Dave and his growing group of allies ate away at my territory until eventually the fateful day came. I was down to my last clutch of core colonies. I thought of the years I’d spent carefully planning and developing them. And now I had to look Dave in the eyes and yield. And he was still. Fucking. Smiling.  Welcome back, everyone.  I am so glad you are still with us.  This is part seven, and we are not done yet.

The Takers were back, she was sure of it before she even opened her eyes.  Back to inflict more misery.    After they took her, the first time they came to her cell they brought her a prisoner's ration.  The hand-sized portion she supposed was meant to last a full night.  They gave her a thin, pasty, foul-smelling gruel made from nought but roots and leaves.  It barely filled her stomach, for a time, and did little else.  She could probably digest a tenth of it, perhaps.  They’d stopped feeding her after that night, instead coming only to talk then scream at her.  They offered more gruel for cooperation.  When she had refused to respond, they tormented her with water as freezing as a stream from the high country and more forceful than the Western Paratana River.  By the third day, she was weak and delirious with hunger.  She would have killed them had she the chance, to be sure.  Not only would their behavior have warranted death were they her own kind, but these were the monsters of her childhood.  Everyone in her land had been taught about the Takers since the time they were children.  Never travel, play, or hunt alone, they said.  They will find you and steal you away, never be heard from again.  If you’re lucky, they said, they will kill you before they take you and only your body will be lost.  If they killed you in in the sky, your immortal soul would be doomed to wander from star to star, searching for home.  Only one person had *ever* gotten away from them, and Arrinis was no Marchioness Captain-General Illmanokh.  She remembered seeing her orations as a young girl and hearing all the stories.  She remembered rolling her eyes, not just thinking, but *knowing* they were fables and tales of fancy meant to keep children from getting lost or hurt.  By the almighty, how wrong she was.        One thing she did not expect, however, was that she would have to *eat* her childhood monsters just to survive.  That was…  Unexpected.  The worst part was how they upset her stomach, honestly, and tasted of six different kinds of foulness.  Still, suffering from indigestion and ill humors had to be better than starving to death or going blind from lack of meat.  It wasn’t an ideal solution.  The things were tall but terribly skinny, and most had thick layers of fur or feathers.  That meant there wasn’t much food to be had; perhaps enough good meat on each for three steak pie suppers and, from the gristle, maybe another two blocks of head cheese or a dozen rings of black pudding.  That was the best-case scenario, but quite a bit of the leftovers had started to turn.  She, of course, had to dine without the benefit of a proper butcher’s preparations.    Part of her wondered if that made her a cannibal, but the rest of her didn’t give a damn.  She was mad with hunger when she accidently killed the first one, hungrier when she ate it, and knew she would be hungry again when she killed its friends.  Were they people just because they could talk?  She doubted it.  They didn’t look like people.  They looked like scared cattle or seafood that could walk.  Would she have eaten a talking fish if she was hungry enough?  Apparently so.  On the sixth day, like every day before, someone came to yell and blast her with frozen water until her flesh was raw and torn.  She realised something  important in that moment.  The water had pounded Arrinis while she huddled like a formless mass of rotwood, pressed to the ground over the corpses of her enemies, holding their bones, skin, and offal tight to her chest to stop their sustaining remnants from washing away.  She knew she had become an animal, a fearsome, unintelligent beast concerned with nothing but survival.  That knowledge brought her a kind of peace.  They thought of her as an animal, caged her like an animal, so she would stop fighting it and become an animal.       She cursed them all the way to the demon king himself and, for her troubles, screamed herself hoarse in the process.  She knew better than to say anything that could be remotely useful to them.  Nothing could help her now, least of all dignifying them with any real response.  She had trained as a home-guardswoman since her twelve year, been a sapper since her fifteenth, and a longbowoman since her eighteenth.  She had studied for countless fortnights to earn those positions, and those vellum texts had etched themselves onto her mind.  The first rule of being captured by the enemy was to give them nothing and tell them nothing because they would use everything against you.  And now, now they had woken her up to torture her yet again.  After two whole nights and days of peace, she had begun to faintly hope they had had their fill of inflicting suffering.  In the intervening nights, she had barely enough time to dry and redress her wounds with the torn remnants of her chemise.  It had been too much to hope for.  Holding herself, she began to shake in place, clenching her teeth and squeezing her eyes shut to hold back the tears.  Arrinis would not let them see her suffer.   She slowly opened her eyes.  Listening to their noises, she again accepted her fate.  The witch-fire wall between her cage and the surrounding room would let *in* things like water and sounds and probably arrows, but none of the same could she send outwards, nor could she be heard.     “-think there’s been some kind of mistake here.” she could hear someone say.  His voice, his real voice, not the one the imp they put in her ear used, sounded different from the others.  It reminded her of barking; higher pitched than theirs, but still sounding deep to her, like a man’s.    She had never seen it before, but the new visitor looked almost like a proper gentleman, though his legs were too straight and his face a bit odd.  He looked much more *normal* than the other monsters, and more approachable, more personable.  If he was indeed a monster at all and not something else entirely.  Whatever it was, it was with the Takers and she would kill it.  She had no room for mercy in her heart for any of the Takers or their serfs, servants, kith or kin.  If the opportunity presented itself, it would die like the others and sustain her for another week, at least.    On the off chance that the witch-fire yielded so the creature could approach, she began scraping around the floor.  She would find a bone to throw from amongst her rotting friends that served as her only food and companionship.  She first found a fragment of skull from the one she named Fyrnle, the brains scooped out days ago.  They had been too fatty, but with a pleasant measure of saltiness.  She threw it aside.  A whole skull might have been better, but his, like the others, had been crushed when she pulled them through her cell bars.  Reaching down again, she found his jaw.  Or beak.  Or something.  Whatever it was, though spindly, it was large and had quite a bit more heft than the other remaining pieces.  It would more than suffice to dispatch one of these feeble Takers.  She approached the bars slowly, as if she were stalking game, which, in a sense, she was.  The strange visitor was distracted, knocking at the door to her outer room, asking to-    In an instant the witch-fire’s hum died and she threw.  Her sudden reaction surprised even herself.  She hardly expected the witch-fire to actually depart, nor even realised she’d been preparing to throw.  Oh well, it was what it was.  Any second thoughts on the matter were pointless.  Goodbye, Fyrnle’s jaw-beak.  Goodbye, new visitor.  One of the Empress’s best archers, Arrinis’ aim had been true, the new visitor dead, and-  “Ow!  Who bonked me?!?”  Arrinis let out a squeak, jumping back three whole paces and upwards at least two.  She landed with a bang followed by the awkward scrabbling of claws on metal as she righted herself.  *That* wasn’t supposed to happen.    It definitely wasn’t dead and she’d only made it cross. It had moved so quick, she hadn’t even seen the thing turn to face her, nor take up what was unmistakably a fighting stance.  Unlike with every other being on this ship, some of whom were twice her height, she suddenly become aware of how much larger than her he was.  Suddenly, Arrinis *really* wanted to apologise.  “Hello? Who’s there?!?” the man demanded.  He took a step back and began scanning the dark room.  “That fucking hurt…  Right in the head, too… I think I’m bleeding, damn it.”   It stomped its foot onto the floor in frustration, so loud she jumped again.  She could *feel* the the vibrations moving through the ground and into her.     “Human,” the walls spoke.  She recognised that voice.  It was the warden.  That evil creature.  That vile thing that she wanted dead more than life itself.  What it had done to her…  She suppressed a shiver just thinking about it.  “I’m onto you, deathworlder” the voice continued from a raised indentation in the wall, “We know what your people are, what they’re capable of.  And now, you’ve met your match.  Human from Lost Sanity, meet the Night Beast from Nyx.  You may kill each other now.”*Just a little short something that I felt like writing.  It's good to finally get through some writer's block and put words down.  I'm not sure how good this is, but I got a laugh thinking of it, so I hope you enjoy it too.*_____Chi -Captain, Polgara- Xhin stalked down the cold metal corridor in the inner depths of his ship.  Jangar ships were designed, like every species ships, in a way that made sense to their builders.  And so, while his ship had the bridge midway down the spine for a commanding view of battle, and the shield generators situated nearest the fighter bays to screen them during launch, so was their brig here, deep inside the ship.  So that anyone trying to escape from the lackluster guards on punishment duty here would have to fight through the whole ship to get to anything resembling escape. Of course, that meant that the captain had a long walk to interrogate a prisoner.  But it was worth it, sometimes. As Xhin came to the one bulky door with a guard outside, he saluted and gave a dismissing gesture.  The guard moved quickly to open it for him, either out of respect, or simply bored enough to take any chance at work.  The smell of the harsh cleaning substances used on the floors and recycled air of the hallway was replaced by a more lively scent as he stepped inside; the smell of heavy breath, body heat, and blood. Stepping into the interrogation chamber, he gave a shuffling of his neck frills.  Similar to a human sigh, but with the added cultural connotation of showing that one was comfortable enough to express that sort of relief.  Comfortable enough, because they were in command of the situation, and the only other person in the room was strapped to a very unpleasant looking chair. The human had been captured during a raid on one of their fleet resupply stations two days ago, and his presence offended the captain.  He was clearly not a warrior; none of the layered muscle mass or implanted weaponry that they'd found on human marines.  Instead, it had a mess of short blond hair that reminded Xhin too much of his own down, and soft eyes in a soft face that was, currently, bleeding. Why was it bleeding?  He hadn't ordered any interrogations to start.  Unacceptable.  "Guard!"  The shouted command gave no room for interpretation, and the unfortunate enlisted sailor scurried into the room behind him. "Yes, captain?"  The underling asked, saluting, a look of minor fear in his eyes. "Did you damage the prisoner before I got here?"  The question was direct.  He'd learned, in his years as captain, that being direct was the best way to get straight answers; crewmen could find so many ways to avoid giving a response that might offend a superior. The guard broke eye contact, guild painted on his face.  "Sir, he was... insulting.  I overreacted and..."  The explanation began, but it was too late.  Xhin had a duty as captain, after all. The plasma blade took the guard's arm off at the second elbow.  Nothing overly serious, and to his credit, he didn't even scream as the limb hit the floor.  Merely grinding his teeth together, a small bit of fluid leaking from the side of his mouth.  Retracting the blade, Xhin gave a short nod as the punishment for failure was completed effectively.  "Get out, take that with you."  He gestured to the chunk of flesh.  If the crewman got to the medbay in time, they might yet survive to be discharged at the next stop. As the hatch closed behind the retreating back of the guard, Xhin turned around to see the human with his mouth hanging open.  "Holy shit!" it blurted out. "I apologize, human, for the failure of my guard.  You were not to be damaged before interrogation."  He may be a Jangar captain of a top of the line battleship, and they may be at war with humanity, but there was no reason not to be polite. This human, though, seemed far less inclined toward protocol.  "Fuck that!  You don't need to interrogate me at all!  I'll tell you whatever you want!  Just don't chop my fucking arms off!" Odd.  This was not normally how interrogations with human military personnel went, and Xhin said as much.  "Why are you so eager to betray your people?" The human kept taking glances at the small box on Xhin's belt from which the plasma blade could be produced as he answered.  "Man, I'm not trained to resist torture.  You'll get it out of us anyway, so engineers are just trained to tell you what you want, and try to negotiate release.  Um... can I be released?" "No."  The question was different.  But his answer was not. "Worth a try."  The human sighed.  "So, what do you want to know so you don't cut me up?" This was going much smoother than expected.  With a bit of luck, he'd have something positive to report to his superiors without having to embellish anything.  "Well, to start with, tell me your name, and function." "I'm Engineer Second Class Michael Barclay.  I work primarily on post-repair inspections.  I'm... kind of my crew's intern, almost?  I spend a lot of time doing paperwork.  Writing reports on problems with warship construction, that sorta thing." "So, would you be able to tell me about the human forces during the Second Battle of Valhalla?"  Information on their new weapons deployed there would be quite valuable. The human... Barclay... gave a confused look.  "I mean, if I remember the reports correctly, it was mostly just having an equal number of ships, and we still took heavy losses?  I'm not an admiral, dude." He checked his datapad for recommended questions.  "Rrm.  Well.  What about construction on new human dreadnaughts?  Would that be within your realm of specialization?" "Oh, yeah, I mean.  Kind of?  We've been having trouble with fighter manufacturing since there's usability problems with the amp crystals we've been using.  It's setting us back a while on the new carrier launches." Ah, actual useable data.  This would explain why their fleets had been seeing fewer carriers.  What else could he get from this strangely helpful human?  "The repair procedures for your destroyer vessels.  Are you retrofitting them as they are fixed from battle damage?" "Oh, man."  Despite the human's restraints, he still seemed to sigh with his whole body.  "You would not believe how much of a clusterfuck it is to patch up a destroyer."  Xhin unfurled a single shoulder tendril in interest, and either Barclay knew enough about Jangar physiology to know that it meant to go on, or else he was too caught up and did so anyway.  "The management is a nightmare; there's usually three people in charge of different parts of the project, and they never coordinate properly.  It takes FOREVER to get decent orders, so we usually just end up having to set up our own comms with other teams, and working that way.  It's a giant pain in the ass to actually fix anything.  We're supposed to retrofit too, but the supply runs never arrive quite in time, so we work with what we have just to get it battle ready." "That is... fascinating.  Are all engineering pursuits run this way?" Barclay shrugged as much as he could.  "I dunno, I mean, I haven't seen any reports on it.  It looks like it's just the destroyers because they're a lower priority." Xhin made some notes on his datapad.  "Thank you.  That is... useful, I think.  Or at least something I can report to my superiors.  This has been a very productive interrogation, and I don't think I'll need to injure you at all." "Oh, well, *thanks*"  Barclay may have become a little too comfortable after being allowed to ramble about workplace problems.  Enough so to express sarcasm, at any rate. The captain turned to leave, then thought for a minute, and turned back.  Disabling the recording feature on his data pad, he set it aside on the small table, and leaned forward.  "I have... one final question.  Just from me." Now it was the engineer's turn to raise an eyebrow.  "Yeah?" "How?  How are you winning the war?"  The question was treason.  If anyone heard him ask it, he'd be executed for sure, but he had to know. "What?  Are you nuts?  I thought you guys were winning?"  No sarcasm this time, just pure surprise The response shocked the captain as much as the question had his prisoner.  "You steal victory at every opportunity!  You cut down strategic targets wherever they are presented!  Your people are ruining mine, and this war is tilting in balance, and I want to know; for a species that reports nothing but failure, HOW ARE YOU WINNING?!" His voice had risen to a shout, and he was glad now that he'd sent the guard away before beginning here.  The human had leaned back, perhaps in fear, as the captain had grabbed the arms of the chair and pushed forward, demanding to know the secret. "Um... um.... we... thought you were winning?"  The panicked words spilled out of the man, and before he could be asked anything else, he kept going, out of fear of retribution.  "I mean, we have access to your datanet, and I'm sure you have some of ours, and yours doesn't have any propaganda or media or anything, it's all just victory reports and almost no loss mentions, and your maintenance guys keep everything in perfect order, and your tech seems about fifty years ahead of ours, and it's just a little demoralizing, you know?  We're just barely hanging on, and you're crushing us?" The captain leaned back, looking down on the somewhat pathetic engineer.  He began to understand what had happened.  "What," he asked, "is your job?  Your specific day to day job?" "Well, like I said, I mostly write reports on spot-failure in battleship systems." "Failure.  Reports on failure." The human kept trying to cower away from the captain's form, even though the restraints would never allow it.  "Yeah?  So?" "And you are alive." "CAN I PLEASE STAY THAT WAY?" Captain Xhin gave a shuffling, as he stepped back.  "Do you know," he said in an almost conversational tone, speaking to himself as much as to Barclay, "that I am missing two fingers?  Memories of minor failures from my early days in the service."  He paced for a bit, muttering to himself as the captive human silently watched in apprehension.  "Failures, failures. They report failures."  Raising his voice, he turned again to face his prisoner.  "Do you know what happens to a Jangar that reports failure?  Of course you do, you saw.  That is not the act of a particularly brutal taskmaster, that is common.  That is how the Nine Empresses decree it.  Failure must not reach the ears of your betters.  It must be dealt with, personally.  Or, when that cannot happen, it must be covered up, so no one can ever know your shame." "Um... that..."  The human started, but the Jangar captain cut him off. "Yes, that.  That is why there is no propaganda on our datanet.  That is why it is all real reports, and all utterly useless.  That is why captains must often guess at what is wrong, or make foolish maneuvers to cover for flawed strategies.  That is why.... you are winning." "We all make mistakes."  Barclay spoke with a steady voice for the first time in the interrogation. Xhin looked at him for a very long time.  "We do."  He said.  "But only one of our people's is bold enough to admit it.  Tell me, what happens when you write your reports?" "They get filed with fleet command, and then a more experienced engineer designs the problem out of existence."  An engineer's answer, but it made sense. The captain smiled.  "Of course they do.  And they aren't punished or executed, so they become more experienced in things other than lying to their superiors.  I understand.  Too late, but I understand..."  He trailed off, before going over and snapping off the restraints of the human prisoner. Massaging his wrists, Barclay looked at his captor.  "So... what now?" "Now, I will submit the report of this interrogation.  I will do my best to show the dangers posed by humanity without making the Jangar appear weak, and I will then await both my own execution and yours when the information causes us to lose ships in another fleet engagement.  It will be... a tiring week.  Though I will try to keep you comfortable.  This war has been... foolish.  I should not say that, but it doesn't matter much now.  My fate is inevitable, I suppose." Barclay leaned forward, pulling something out of his boot.  "I mean, you could  do that."  He pulled back up, a small black box in his hand.  "Or, I mean, you don't seem like a bad guy.  Maybe we could try an alternative to your shitty plan where we both die?" "What is that?" "Pocket knife.  You really need to talk to your guards about proper search procedures.  Someone should write..." "A report, yes, well.  We've talked about this." "Right.  Well, I mean, I was hoping to escape this ship and maybe get back to human space.  Want to come along?  I mean, if you're dead anyway." Xhin looked over at the human, the man's eyes now scanning the room in a much more precise way than before, with a much more direct look on his face.  The look of someone who was used to solving problems, and recovering from minor setbacks like being taken captive on an enemy warship.  "I don't suppose... your military has a place for a now-confirmed failure that's committed treason against a rival government?" "Ah!  Already going for an officer position, eh?" _____ Captain Chi Xhin of the FSS Ascension Into Redemption sat calmly on the bridge of his warship, crew busy around him.  In the last four years since his escape, he had become a bit of an important figure to the resistance movement among his first people.  As the first actual defector to then join the Federation Space Service, he was a symbol that any Jangar, even one who had fought against humanity, could find a place among them if they so chose.  And he had used his position to recruit quite a few of his old people into the new Federation that the humans were forming.   He was a bit iffy on the idea of a multi-species government and society, but that was sort of the reason he stuck around.  He could tell people that, and then, instead of removing limbs or tendrils, they would talk with him, until someone's opinion changed, the coffee ran out, or the war called them back to duty.  It was a novel experience for someone who grew up in the Emperium, and he was quite enjoying it so far. To the Federation sailors on his bridge, he was known as Smiles, when they thought he couldn't hear them.  And he took a bit of personal delight in knowing that he didn't have to personally injure them for their words.  Which, of course, fed back into the nickname. Right now, they were preparing for a battle; a Jangar fleet, one far too small for this fight, had just jumped into realspace around Valhalla again, and Xhin was the senior officer in the defense forces stationed here.  Of course, after the heavy losses of the last battle, humanity had reinforced the guard post here to something capable of handling anything.  The Jangar, naturally, had sent a basically identical fighting force, as no one would have dared suggest improvements to the last High Commander's plan. "Crew!"  He spoke out, firmly and with a note of amusement.  "We are about to enter a deathly dance with the enemy!  Tell me, is everything perfect?" A few of the bridge crew cracked out in smiles of their own.  This ritual of theirs now part of the ship's own culture.  "No captain!"  Came back a chorus of answers. "And is everything going according to plan?" "Of course not, captain!" "Crew, tell me.  How absolutely infallible am I?" "We don't trust you with anything more dangerous than string, captain!"  That last line was different every time, and he'd noticed that they seemed to have a rotation of who got to deliver it.  He was wondering if they drew straws to decide. Xhin smiled broadly as the enemy warships moved into engagement range.  "Then everything is right with the world!  Helm, move us into position, and let us begin. Welcome to part eight.  I appreciate your patience.  Don’t worry, this story will go where it needs to go in due time.  Again note that certain words are used because they are the closest equivalents to the ideas being conveyed.  I respect the desire for longer stories, but unfortunately it isn't possible for me with my schedule.  You may be happy to note that this part is longer than normal.  Please enjoy.  …  “Human from Lost Sanity, meet the Night Beast from Nyx.  You may kill each other now.”  No, no, no…  She wasn’t some night-beast.  Not at all.  Just a woman.  A farm-girl, really, with a meaningless title.  An unimportant woman, hardly worth mentioning, actually...  Arrinis silently cursed the warden as the creature, this man named Human, blindly searched for her.  She tried to secret herself into a corner of her cage with as little sound as possible.  It didn’t work; she could see the man’s eyes tracking her, honing in on her hiding spot.  Like the others, she doubted it could not see without the sun, but that seemed to make little to no difference.  She made almost no sound, but it could *hear* her moving, maybe even breathing.  She felt sure of it.  The damn thing came from a place called *Lost Sanity*, too.  With a name like that, the place could have been some fantastic underworld from an epic poem where beings didn’t need sight to see.  For the first time in weeks, her rage had fully given way to fear.  She heard her cage opening, the clockwork engines deep within cycling.  At any point from the time she had arrived in this cursed dungeon until now, she would have prayed for her cell to open.  Now, she fervently prayed for it to remain shut.  “What the hell is a Night Beast?!?” Human asked, his eyes sightlessly shifting to the whining hinge.  She gulped.  It wasn’t her, no, definitely not.  No way.  She began to wonder if one of her skeleton friends could maybe cover for her.  Rewdigthr?  Fyrnle?  Twynargard?  Anyone?  None volunteered.  Traitors, all of them.   “Your doom!” shouted the warden.  Doom?  *Doom?*  If they fought and she actually ended up killing this man it would be an absolute miracle.  Against one of her fellow dames, strikes to the head like the one she just delivered would have laid them all low to a woman, if even for just a moment.  That huge man hadn’t even lost his footing.  She was hardly his doom.  A better descriptor might be ‘more-difficult-than-average sparring dummy.’  “-She’s a carnivorous killing machine with razor sharp teeth, massive claws, and a taste for intelligent *meat*.  We’ll see who survives.”   All technically true, but really-  “What the fuck?!?” screamed Human, banging on the door with lightning-fast punches.  From across the room, she could feel each impact in her bones.  She didn't want to be anywhere near this creature.  “You want me to fight some animal?  What is this, some kind of gladiator bloodsport?  Why would you do that?  What…  I’m a simple man, a small, defenseless herbivore!  You’re just going to feed me to it?  Why?  I’ll have no chance!”  It was bargaining.  Or it knew she was listening and hoping to lull her into complacency.  Either way, she was *highly* skeptical.  “Ha!  It’s not any bigger than you,” said the warden, “You might stand a chance.”  “Jesus Christ, mountain lions aren’t any bigger than me, either!,” Human yelled back, ”When I get out of here I’ll fucking kill you, slaver scum!”  And *now* she wanted to be his friend.     That might have been easier said than done.  Sure, she could just march right up to the gentleman, introduce herself, explain herself and her terrible mistake, and hope for the best.  It might work.  The second rule of being taken prisoner was to find allies and unite with your fellow prisoners around the common goals of resistance and escape.  They certainly had a common enemy and the gentleman was surely intelligent enough to see that.  On the other hand, this man could be extremely dangerous and might not even be in his right mind, if the name of his homeland meant anything.  Not only that, but she could clearly see, and smell, that she’d drawn first blood.  Though she would seek his forgiveness, he need not offer it, and without it he was entitled to strike her down.  And at the moment, he seemed rather angry.   Arrinis pushed all fear and doubt aside.  Only cooperation would lead to salvation.  She took a deep breath and drew herself up to her full height and slowly strode toward Human.  They were not going to fight for this sadist’s amusement; they were going to clear this up like the lady and gentlemen they were.  She would first work up the courage to introduce herself to Human and together, the pair would find a way out of this mess.  For the first time since being taken, she began to feel a glimmer of hope.  “If you get out of here, you can come find me, Human,” said the warden from the wall, “I think the beast stalking towards you right now will have something else to say about that…”  In a flash, it turned from the warden’s voice and looked her right in the eyes.  She froze.  Shit.  It had been playing blind?  “Not if I kill it first, you son of a *bark*”  “Wait, no, Stop!  My name is Arrinis of Karamast! Daughter of-!”   The world went white around her and she fell to her knees.  She couldn’t breath; she had to vomit, but couldn’t gag.  Her hands flew to her throat as she gasped for air, frantically trying to roll away from Human as the looming man stalked towards her.  She hadn’t even seen what had happened, he had moved so fast.  It had hit her hard in the throat, either with a punch or using its hand like a knife to jab or slash.  It hadn’t been as effective as clawed kick might have been, but it struck faster and would be no less deadly if it happened a second time.  Regaining her bearings, she began scooting backside away from the man.  With one hand she searched for bones and pulled herself along, with the other she massaged her almost useless throat.  With her legs, she used one to push herself away, holding the other aloft but ready to kick out at Human’s torso.        “Please…” she tried to croak, rubbing her throat, imploring the lunatic man, “Stop…”  *”Bark arf bark bark”*  It danced around her, clearly wary of her clawed foot.  She struck out, barely tearing its silk tunic as it dodged.  She had been taught never to hit a gentleman, but she would definitely make an exception in his case.  It pushed toward her from the side, and she moved back an equal measure.  It hurt to breath and she was fast running out of room to maneuver.  She kicked again and it dodged just as quickly.  “My name… Arrinis…” she wheezed again, her words sounding strangled.  She *had* to explain that she was a person, damn it, not some beast.  “Daughter of Lady Jeruselka…”   This time the man lunged with his arm.  She kicked at it and missed.  She barely spotted the man’s other arm as it tried to catch her foot.  She rolled in place, bringing that extended foot to the ground while her other foot spun up to take its place, tearing deeply into the man’s forearm.  It barked in rage.  She scooted back another two paces.  “Dame Commander…!” she choked.  What madness had come over this thing?  Did it just like killing things?  “...in Her Imperial Majesty’s Order-”  She had slid her way right into a corner.  The man had planned it that way, and she had played right into it.  She was just another cornered animal, fighting for her life.  Another lunge, another kick in response.  She was ready for when he tried to catch her foot again, and kicked up with her other leg.  This time, she missed.  The human had caught her by the second foot.  His other hand quickly grabbed her leg by the hock, seizing it firmly in place.  In an instant he rolled to the ground, keeping his body on the side of her immobile leg, stopping her from kicking out with either.  He fell atop her, releasing her leg as he landed.    He rolled her chest-first into the ground while she alternated between elbowing his ribs and stomach and using her fists to hammer at his thighs.  Setting all decency aside in desperation, she tried to grab and tear at his manhood, but he kept his hips pressed firmly against her buttocks, leaving no room to strike.  She tried another tactic, pushing herself off the ground.  That only made things worse.  Using the gap between her body and the floor, the man wrapped one arm around her entire body just beneath her bosom, locking her arms at her sides and crushing her torso into his.  She began throwing her head backwards, fighting with every little scrap of energy and whatever tools she had left at her disposal.  She felt gratified when the back of her head made contact with the man’s odd nose, feeling it crushed as it made a soft crackling sound.  It was odd.  She had always enjoyed hand-to-hand combat.  Were she not facing a certain and swift death, she might have admitted to finding the sensations of the hot-breathed gentleman holding her tightly, pressing his body into hers from behind to be mildly concupiscent.  She normally preferred her gentlemen to not be so forward, however.  And not quite this big.   “*Bark!  Bark woof bark Baaaaark!  Boof*,” is said.  The imp!  The imp was gone.  It had stopped translating his words, so it must not be translating hers either.  That's why they couldn’t understand each-   The man’s second arm joined the first, this time sliding up to her neck.  The first hand then moved from her below her bosom to her forehead, preventing her chin from guarding her throat.  With a roll, he was beneath her now, with both of them facing the ceiling.  His legs snaked around hers, holding them down.  He pressed in tight against her throat with his bleeding forearm and thick bicep, almost like a piece of wrought iron trying to remove her head.  Her sight began flashing white again, this time starting at the edges.  She could barely breath as it was, but this was something else.  An excruciating pressure built inside her skull.  She was going to die in mere moments.  Her soul would wander from star to star.  She wanted to make peace with the almighty in her last seconds, but she could only think of fighting.  Fighting against this man-beast named Human.  Pointless.  Sure, she was caught by surprise, but she honestly thought she would have stood a better chance.  Instead, she was little more than a stupid slashing-dummy.  Not even a proper sparring partner for him.  Sparring.  *Sparring*.  She immediately stopped all fighting and went limp, slapping his arm at her throat three times.  Her vision was fully white now and she could not see.  She could barely feel anything of her body beyond the arm at her throat.  Would it understand?  This was just a translation problem, right?  This man had to be intelligent, not a killer or a monster or a lunatic.  Had to be…  In her final fading moments, she slapped his arm slowly, firmly, deliberately, three more times.  After the third time, something happened.  She could barely tell that the pressure on her neck was gone and her body had been shifted gently to the floor.  Something soft had been placed under her head.  The gentleman was no longer pressed against her.  Though blurred, her vision began to return.  She stared at the ceiling and blinked tears from her eyes.  Human was crouching above her.  “*Bark?  Bark bark woof* okay?” it asked.  “My name is Lady Arrinis of Karamast,” she barely managed to whisper, “Daughter of Lady Jeruselka, Dame Commander in Her Imperial Majesty’s Order of the Sacred Guard and I am not an animal.”  Arrinis’ head fell to the side as she lost consciousness. I am humbled that so many people have enjoyed this adventure.  Tomorrow’s update may be delayed a few hours, I think.  …  Life-harboring worlds were graded on a scale for habitability to sentient life.  A Class-1 world was a perfect garden world.  Class-2 worlds might have chilly weather.  His own world was considered rather austere, good for developing a tough and hardy people.  It was Class-5.  Class-6 worlds were tough places that few visited.  Some of the fiercest warrior peoples came from them.  They got worse as the numbers went up.  There was only one race participating in the galactic community from a Class-8 world and most people avoided them at all costs.  From there they became even harsher and more hazardous to sentient life, all the way up to Class-10 worlds, which were considered uninhabitable.  Deathworlds.  Sentients did not, could not, come from a deathworld.    Of course, just because something had never happened before didn’t mean it could never happen.  He just wished it hadn’t happened on *his ship.*         The habitation scale for temperate planets was pretty linear from one to ten.  It was supposed to end there.  But at some point, scientists noticed that there were worlds which went to such great lengths to exterminate all life that visited that they far surpassed even Class-10.  Learned minds developed an extended scale, and each step in that scale was exponentially more deadly than the previous one.  Class-11 worlds, like Nyx, home of the Night Beasts, were almost a joke, a one-to-ten scale turned up to eleven.  As for Class-12, well, he hadn’t heard of such a thing until this very moment when it had suddenly stopped being funny.  “Is something wrong?” the creature asked.  Keep it talking, damn it, his mind pleaded with his body, willing his tongue to move and his lips to part.  “No, not at all,” the captain said, clasping his hands together in an effort to get them to stop shaking.    He had an idea, half-formed and conceived in terror, but an idea nonetheless. Carefully, he turned his data-pad back on.  He had to type much slower.  His fingers kept missing the correct spots, even on second and third tries.  He typed with two, then three digits tightly pressed together to lessen their shaking.  This time his message was to Ghinta, the ship’s vet.    ‘Have you completed the drug yet?’  A few moments later came a long reply.  ‘No.  We’ve been testing different things on the blood and tissue samples, but nothing seems to work, and even if it did, we probably wouldn’t be able to manufacture enough aboard for it to matter.’  ‘What about the Night Beast tranquilizer???’ he typed.  ‘Might work...  The two are similar.  High metabolic rate, blood based on iron carrying oxygen, other things.  Or it might do nothing at all’  She was damn right they were similar.  But if it didn’t work...  ‘How many doses do we have left?’  ‘Only two.  If the human is compliant, it only makes sense to save them in case we need them for *her*.’  He let out a slow breath of air, closed his eyes and concentrated.  She was right, of course.  This thing, less than a meter from him, was compliant for the moment.  Pointing a weapon like a dart gun at it would almost certainly trigger it to kill.  Unlike a Night Beast there was no possible way a creature as smart and advanced as this would not know what a gun was, and the ship was too small to allow it to be shot from the relative safety of a great distance.  In these confines, he had no doubt that the thing could kill or disarm, literally, an attacker faster than anyone aboard could even pull a trigger.   And all that was assuming the Night Beast sedative could even work.   He could also forget locking it in its cabin.  For one, it could probably beat down the thin door without much trouble.  For another, that would only postpone the problem.  It would eventually find out that it was taken by a slave ship.  If the Night Beasts were any indication, deathworlders could not just accept that fact, regardless of the circumstances or conditions.  When it would find out, well, he could maybe hope it would be after finding a buyer and making a sale, but Antiktun couldn't be certain.  Until then, it would be like having having an unexploded warhead rolling around in storage.  Or worse.  A primitive Class-11 would just kill everyone aboard, steal his ship, and escape home.  An advanced Class-12?  Not even Antiktun’s family was safe.  Seven hells, the thing would probably take his ship, infiltrate his homeworld, find a way blow it up, and then escape home.  Antiktun had to deal with this *now*.  So the drugs were a complete waste.  Honestly, had the veterinarian been watching vids this entire time?  Couldn’t she appreciate how potentially dangerous this thing was?  He needed another idea; something he could actually use.  He might be able to think of a way to fool it, to take advantage of its current willingness to cooperate, in order to eliminate it as a threat.  That meant a battle of wits with a being whose race had intelligence as its only natural weapon.  An intelligence which allowed them to evolve on, survive on, thrive on, and probably like most sentients, dominate on its homeworld.  And that homeworld was a deathworld.  They were all going to die painfully.  ‘I agree with your assessment, thank you,’ he typed to Ghinta, wondering if it would be his last message.  Better to go out with some sense of satisfaction.  ‘Before tomorrow, I need you clean out the waste chutes in all the slave quarters.  Yes, *all* of them.’    Despite his almost complete inability to think of anything beyond getting the hells out of there, one more idea pressed its way into his fore-brain only because he had already been toying with the notion earlier. He just had to calm himself and maintain enough control to carry it out.  It wasn’t going to be pretty, but it was probably the only thing Antiktun could do to keep himself, his ship, and most of his merchandise in one piece.  If the Night Beast somehow died, it was only a financial loss.  He would be in debt to his investor, maybe sold into slavery if he had to default, but he’d be alive.  He might even be able to buy his way out of it eventually.  On the other hand, if the human died, he would build a shrine to the Five Lords of Heaven.  Regardless of the outcome, he saw no other choice.  “I want to give you a tour of the ship,” he smoothly told the creature, “How does that sound?”  “Yeah, sure,” said the thing.  The captain swallowed his sigh of relief.  …  Together they walked from deck to deck and room to room, the captain explaining briefly what each part of the ship was used for.  He had to make most of it up as he wasn’t too clear on where his crew did what they did or why or how they did it.  For their part, the crew were thankfully silent as the odd pair walked about, knowing better than to ask questions.  Either that, or they were too put off by the rumors of the human that were doubtlessly already spreading.  Though he showed the crew quarters, the captain made sure to avoid the standard slave cells amidships.  That would have raised too many questions.  As for the ‘special’ slave cell, they were going to visit that one now.  “I notice there are dozens of different species represented here,” said the cheerful human as they walked, “I talked to your executive officer about it earlier.  It's wonderful, you know, a whole galactic community up here, just waiting for humanity to join.”  The creature seemed so earnest to Antiktun, but at the same time he couldn’t help feeling like it was onto his ruse and was implying a veiled threat.  He could imagine it smiling as it happily slaughtered its way through every living thing aboard, all the while saying how much it wanted to ‘meet his whole community!’     “Oh, yes, there are more than a few races aboard,” the captain agreed.  “We cannot wait for a people as nice as you to join us, either.  In fact, as a representative of your people, I think it’s extremely important that you meet all of the races of the galactic community.  I can’t do much about the ones we don’t have aboard here-”  “How many are there?  Other races in the galaxy?”  The captain’s pace staggered.  Was it normal for this creature’s people to interrupt or was it trying to throw him off?   “Well, I don’t know for sure…” he replied slowly.  “What about on this ship?”  “Twenty six different races, I believe,” he replied, “though the numbers change so frequently.”  In truth he had no idea, but the thing had said he’d seen dozens aboard, so…  The human nodded and they continued on their way.  “As I was saying, it will be important when you return to your kind to have a fully interacted with as many different races of people as possible.  There is someone special I want you to meet.  How is your night vision?” the captain asked, opening a door to a darkened room at the base of a large ramp.  Captain Antiktun held his breath.  The thing’s next answer would doom him or save him.    “Not good,” he said, “Why?”  He thanked every God, Lord, and Demon he could think of.  “Because we’re going in here to say hello,” he said, gesturing for the human to enter the pitch black cargo hold.  As the human entered, Antiktun remained a pace behind.  “It’s dark in here because she’s nocturnal.  She won’t mind being woken up to meet you though, no, not at all.  Let me find a light switch…  One second…  Where is it…  Maybe over here…”  The cargo bay door slammed shut  in front of him with a reverberating thud, trapping the human on the other side with the Night Beast.   *[Previous chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5c93sp/chrysalis_13/)**[First chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/)****Once again, I went over the information contained in the package I had received.Names. Dates. Coordinates.Admiral Kanafter. The Second Surge. The Empyrean Decree.The exact amount of money the destruction of Earth had saved the Gakasna Tribe.The Emperor's name.The locations and future patrol routes of every fleet the Galactic Council still had in the Orion Arm. I had already sent orders to the rest of my army to move and intercept these once they finished their current assignments. They would be easier to defeat if I caught them unaware and in transit, before they had the time to group together.The exact coordinates of the Empyrean Palace.An opening. A time and place I could warp to, undetected.Right here, right now.And then, only at the very end... a request. A plea. A small one, given everything this benefactor was giving me in return. That I left the Anacax tribe -or nation, as they were calling themselves now- intact. That I allowed them to live.A plea I didn't intend to pay any heed to, of course.Back when I was going over the ruins of the first colony world I attacked, I had already realized the Xunvir Republic was segregated, its population split into different cultural factions. I had briefly considered the idea of taking advantage of that by pitting these factions against each other, though I hadn't really committed to that plan.But it looked like I had managed to do exactly that, even if unaware. The huge pressure I had put the Xunvirians under had exacerbated their differences, turning the thin fissures in their society into massive fractures. And now, one of the tribes had decided that the best way to save their own skins was to throw their former comrades under the bus, so to speak.They were idiots, if they thought they could escape my retribution simply by bribing me.But whatever their reasons were, they had given me an opening, an advantage I intended to press. Which was why I was currently approaching the capital planet of the Xunvir Republic along with two support ships, and a couple hundred thousand drones.It was a small army, I knew. But with the advantage that having the surprise factor granted me, plus the codes and information in my power, I had considered it large enough to make good work of the meager defending forces. The other reason, of course, was that I didn't want to over-commit in case this whole thing turned out to be an ambush of some kind. Granted, losing this army would be an inconvenience, but not a terrible loss in the grand scheme of things.It didn't look like it was an ambush, though. Just as my benefactors had promised, the defending forces had been caught unprepared to my arrival. Not that there was much of a defending force, at any rate. Less than half a dozen Xunvirian vessels, plus an equal number of warships with the wild assortment of varied appearances I had learnt to associate to the Council's military.They were just reacting to my presence, trying to group together into some semblance of organized battle formation. Positioning themselves between my army and the large blue and white planet.Xunvir was large. Much larger than the industrial world I had last attacked. Larger than Earth, even. But the extent of habitable land masses was surprisingly scarce when compared to the sheer size of the planet, with most of the population apparently living in the main supercontinent, about four times the size of Asia. And except for a few archipelagos, the rest of the planet's surface was entirely covered by water.It was, I thought, the very definition of a blue planet.*My bare feet stepping on wet sand. Soft, foamy waves lapping at them. The slight tug when the water recedes. The blue sky and sea fused together, the line separating them impossible to discern.*Floating around the world I detected the eight planetary defense stations the Anacax tribe's message had warned me about. Eight shielded white spheres orbiting Xunvir like small artificial moons, each one carrying a powerful laser projector. The four of them that had me in sight were slowly rotating to face my main body.After surviving the devastating attacks of the Council's starfish battleship and its energy weapon, I couldn't say the sight of these defense stations scared me. I knew that I wouldn't have much problem sustaining whatever damage they could unleash against me while the rest of my army dealt with them.But I didn't have to. I engaged my radio transmitters in the exact frequency the Anacax tribe had instructed me to, and sent a sequence of numeric codes. Ones that identified me and my army as a friendly fleet to the eyes of the automated planetary defense stations' sensors. Immediately they stopped their rotation and started retracting their laser projectors and returning to their stand-by positions.I felt a sense of vicious triumph, that I made sure to broadcast to the rest of the sentient minds in my current army. As usual, they didn't reply. My offspring often talked to each other, but never directly to me unless I ordered them to do so.I guessed I should have felt bad at that. But there was no guilt, no annoyance. Just the same stillness I experienced when killing the Xunvirian survivors, when burning their worlds. The same emptiness.At some point in the past, that stillness had bothered me. But now, even that annoyance was going away, the sense that there was something deeply wrong slowly receding.Because... there wasn't. I was winning, and it didn't worry me. I didn't think I was even capable of worrying about that anymore, in fact. And I preferred it that way. It offered a relief, but it also meant less second guessing, less time wasted going over my feelings. It made it easier for me to do what I knew I had to do.The defense stations were temporarily disabled, but I knew the situation wouldn't last. The Xunvirian officers would be working hard right now to revoke the allied status the forged identity code had granted my forces. But it didn't have to last for long, just the few minutes that it would take my army to destroy the stations while they were defenseless.I sent the order, and half my squads of drones accelerated hard, moving forwards to engage the different spherical stations. The rest of them and my support ships advanced towards the enemy vessels instead, which were already opening fire on us. Apparently the warships' commanding officers were not as easily fooled as the  sensors of the automated defense platforms.Nothing that could represent a menace to my forces, at any rate. The enemy energy beams were scattered and uncoordinated, a reflection of how unprepared they had been to our sudden appearance. It only took a couple minutes for my drones to surround the vessels, spiraling around them and burning their surfaces with hundreds of simultaneous energy beams while my robotic assault spiders crawled into the Council ships. I refrained from using nuclear warheads this time. I already had the upper hand, so I opted instead for trying my best at capturing some of the Council's ships in order to reverse engineer their more advanced technologies later.My drones weren't so considerate towards the defense stations, though. A flash of nuclear light marked the end of one of the massive orbital weapons, quickly followed by three similar detonations at the locations of its counterparts. Then, the drones pulled back on their own, reorganizing themselves and moving in to attack the remaining stations on the opposite side of the planet.It was strange, to observe how my army worked on its own. To see how the sentient drones talked to each other, how they coordinated their movements and approach vectors. How they gave each other the clear before detonating any warhead, so that no intelligent machine was caught in the blasts by mistake.It made me feel oddly redundant. I had relegated myself to the role of an overseer, simply setting the tone and overall flow of the battle. Like some sort of orchestra conductor telling my army to perform the movements we had already trained, but with very limited input over their actual execution.Which was the point, of course. If the Council managed to block my transmissions right now, nothing of substance would really change.I had to remind myself that this was the exception rather than the rule, though. It wasn't common for fights to be so smooth, to always go the way you had previously planned. The only reason we were winning unopposed here was because of the advantage the Anacax tribe had given us. So I knew my role would become critical again once we had to fight more balanced battles in the future, against the remaining Council forces.But for the time being, I could relax, and watch how my army dealt with the enemy on their own. I took notes, evaluating the effectiveness of their formations and maneuvers and trying to find weaknesses in their fighting style that a more organized opposing force might be able to exploit. The information I gathered here would come useful when training the next generation of virtual minds still in the nursery.So far, my main body had remained away at the rearguard. Out of range of the fight itself while I waited for the rest of my forces to clear a path. But now that that was close to being done, I started the second part of my plan. My repaired thrusters engaged simultaneously, accelerating the enormous mass of the twenty-seven kilometers ship.I had been unsure as to what to do regarding my damaged body. While I could have easily repaired and upgraded it, the resources involved into doing that could be better invested into constructing four entirely new support ships instead, with better shield and energy weapons technology than what I had installed in my main body. Even the factories contained in it were unnecessary, falling short of the second generation assembly lines I had been building at the Tau Ceti orbital habitat.Simply put, my body was obsolete.And now that I had started thinking of it as a tool rather than a body, I was realizing how unwieldy it was. Unlike having four or five support ships, a single large vessel couldn't be spread into different armies if I wanted to distribute my strength across several systems at the same time. It lacked versatility, forcing me to commit into certain types of strategy over others. And even then, it didn't offer much more than a big target for the enemy beams, given that my main offensive weapon was my army of drones, and not any sort of device that I carried in the large ship.If I was honest to myself, the reason I had been using it so much was because of my stupid idea of identifying it as a *body*, rather than the ship... the tool it actually was.Useless nostalgia, once again.And even if the large vessel had been my body in the past, it didn't have to remain so in the future. I now could change body with the same ease I had changed clothes in my previous life. I could simply transfer my mind state into one of the support ships, or I could even exist as some sort of disembodied consciousness, running on the servers at any of my many outposts and directing my armies from afar. Now that I didn't have to micromanage the entirety of the swarm, the bandwidth and latency problems of the quantum links weren't that significant.Unabashedly embracing my new digital nature came with a load of privileges. Not only I could be immortal and incorporeal, but I wouldn't need to be subject to the tyranny of warp travel again. I could simply send an army on its way, then transfer my mind via quantum link directly into one of the ships once it reached its destination, entirely bypassing the time I'd have need to spend disconnected while traveling with them.*No. It won't be us.*I cursed myself for my fear, for my misguided reluctance at accepting the advantages my new form granted me. I remembered seeing it as some soft of slippery slope, but I had been wrong. I was still myself just... a better, more optimal and effective myself.And discarding this main body... this twenty-seven kilometers relic was a part of that. A way of sealing this change, of definitely breaking the last ties that still existed with that part of me that had been holding me back, that would have me return to my former nature rather than moving forward.And what better way to discard this body -I thought as I redirected all the energy outputted by its power plants into the repaired thrusters- than to have it crash at full speed into Xunvir's Empyrean Palace. What better way than to transform it into some sort of vengeful technological asteroid.What better way than to provoke an extinction level event... one that cleansed the planet of the plague that had taken root in it.That was why I had remained away from the battle, after all. So that I could have more distance, more time to accelerate even further. That was why the only part of my body I had actually repaired and upgraded had been its thrusters.So I accelerated, carefully plotting my trajectory so that I would fall right on top of the Palace. It felt right somehow, to strike directly at the heart of the Empire that had destroyed Earth. Poetic, in a sense.Still, no matter how maddening my current speed was -and how fast it was increasing with every passing second-, I knew I wouldn't match the impossible speeds of an actual asteroid.Luckily, I didn't have to. I was big, very big, and a quick simulation told me that my current momentum was enough to vaporize a large enough part of Xunvir's crust, sending enormous amounts of rock and debris out of the planet's atmosphere and into suborbital trajectories.The capital city would instantaneously disintegrate under the resulting shockwave from the impact, and the ejected debris would rain back all over the planet and cause the atmosphere to heat due to the new hits. There would be firestorms of continental scale, and a layer of dust and ash would cover the entire world, killing off all plant life in a few weeks or months due to lack of sunlight. Whatever more advanced life survived the initial impact would also perish soon after that.All things considered, it sounded like an effective plan.I pushed my thrusters even harder just as a zipped by the front lines, quickly leaving my army of drones behind as I fell towards the planet. A few virtual alarms blared in my head. Forcing the thrusters to work at this intensity for long would permanently damage them, but given what I intended to do with the ship I was piloting... that wasn't really a concern, so I simply ignored them.I noticed a few Xunvirian vessels were leaving the planet's atmosphere. A quick check of the identification codes they were sending towards me told me they belonged to the Anacax tribe, who were evacuating the Palace just as they had told me in their former communication.This had been part of their plea. They said they wouldn't be able to leave the Palace until my arrival sent the forces loyal to the Republic in disarray, giving them an opening to escape. They had asked me not to attack their evacuation ships, to simply turn a blind eye and allow them to warp away.I considered ordering my army to take them down anyways. I didn't intend to respect this tribe, so it wasn't like I had to follow their instructions. But in the end, I refrained myself. Not because I planned to spare them, but because I doubted destroying these ships would do much damage to the Anacax tribe.No, it would be in my interest to have them believe I was going to respect their terms. That way, they would relax and feel safe, which meant I'd have the surprise factor on my side when I finally turned around to exterminate them. If I attacked now, I'd be tipping my hand.So I remained in silence and watched as the evacuation ships escaped the planet's atmosphere and, one by one, engaged their warp drives and jumped out of the star system. Probably heading back to the industrial world.I put them out of my mind, and focused again on my trajectory, making slight corrections to compensate for the effect of the faint upper atmospheric layer I was starting to pierce.It was then that a new transmission interrupted my thoughts."Hi. My name is Daokat. We have met before, in Yovit. The first colony world you attacked. I was one of the survivors in the crashed spaceship. The one you rescued."It was coming through the same roundabout way the Anacax tribe had used to send me the information package containing their plans. Did that mean this alien creature I had saved was related to that? Had he influenced the tribe somehow to encourage their betrayal?"I... I just wanted to thank you. For saving my life, you know, mine and Telzhira's. And I thought that maybe... that you might want to talk. Just that, talk. No strings attached."I didn't. Not really. I remembered feeling the need to communicate back when I had originally woken up, and how the idea of not ever having any other human to talk to had been unbearable at first.But now... now I had other humans, sort of. The virtual minds I had created.Except that *they* didn't want to talk to me. Which wasn't surprising, not after what I had done to their brains, the shackles I had added into their code.What was surprising was how it didn't really affect me. I didn't mind that they didn't want to talk to me. That they probably hated me. I knew there was something *off* about that, but... I didn't find it in me to be concerned by it. Not anymore.Those worries, that self-doubt... I had casted them away the moment I had decided to accept my new nature. To embrace my immortality.And yet... I sort of wanted to reply. A small part of me felt some mild interest in what the creature would have to say. Some curiosity as to what role if any he had played in the Anacax tribe's defection."I mean," the alien continued, unabated. "I'm not sure if you remember me. You made us a replacement spaceship and-""Yes," I replied at last, "I remember you."Just like the only time I had spoken before -to the Council-, these words were also met by a silence that stretched for a few long seconds. As if he could not believe that I would agree to speak. As if it was an impossibility.I didn't really understand them. He was the one addressing me. So why act so surprised when I decided to respond?When he replied, it wasn't with something I could have expected."Why?"I waited, in case he wanted to clarify the question. But he didn't."Why what?" I said."Why saving us? You didn't have to. But you rescued us, gave us medicine, gave us a way to escape... So I want to know... why?""Because it was fair," I said. "Just like I told the Galactic Council, you were not my enemies.""But still... you didn't have to go to the lengths you went. So I wonder, was that all it was? Wasn't there any reason other than fairness?"I focused on his words, trying to remember. It felt murky. The ruined planet, the corpses, the two creatures. They were hurt, bleeding. And I had... what? I had taken a decision, hadn't I?"An olive branch," I said without thinking. My response almost instinctive."What is that?" he asked."An attempt at coexistence," I clarified, trying to remember what my thoughts had been at the time. "I hoped that by saving you both, we could establish some sort of peace. One that the Council shot down.""That... was a mistake on our part," the alien said. "But you need to understand, the Council didn't know what happened to your species, and they were afraid of you. But we can do better, now that we know. There is still room for peace. I work for the Council, and we can negotiate a ceasefire. This is why I've come here, to Xunvir. But you need to stop. If you destroy this planet, if you kill me... you'll be burning that olive branch of yours."I frowned internally. The attempt at manipulation was obvious. It shouldn't have worked. And yet some part of me felt... something, at the idea of killing the creature. It wouldn't stop me from doing what I had to do. Not really... But I knew I wasn't going to enjoy my victory here. It felt tainted now, somehow."That's unfortunate," I said. "But hardly my responsibility. You weren't supposed to come to this planet, and yet you did despite knowing what my intentions were."He let out a sigh. "Yes, I did come here. Because I wanted to know the truth. Because I wanted to hear about the destruction of your world right from the Emperor's mouth."I felt curious about that. "And did this Emperor admit it?""He did. And I agree with you. What happened to your people was horrible, despicable. It... it demands justice.""Then you understand why I must destroy the Xunvir Republic.""But it happened almost three hundred years ago!" the alien -Daokat- said, raising his voice. "The Empire that did it, it's just gone. Xunvir changed, they abandoned their militaristic ideals. The people alive today, those in this planet... they aren't responsible. They didn't chose to be born the descendants of the ones who murdered your...""But they *are*!" I almost shouted. "I've seen their factories, I've seen their colonies, their resource extraction outposts... All their wealth, their power, their comfort. It comes at the cost of species like mine. This Republic of theirs was erected on top of the ruins of my world!""Which is why there should be reparations, why..."I interrupted him. His words about reparations and sanctions reminded me of my talk with the Council. It sounded nice, but I knew that was all it was... just words. Empty words, at the end of the day."Reparations can't suffice. The Xunvirians murdered my people, so it's only fair I do the same to them."He paused for a few seconds before responding. I noticed my surface temperature was rising as I submerged deeper into the planet's atmosphere."I wonder... does it help?" he said at last. "Calling them 'the Xunvirians', treating them as an uniform group. As if they are all the same, they all think alike. Ignoring that they are individuals, each of them with their own beliefs, aspirations and dreams. That none of the *people* you've killed had anything to do with the decision to destroy your world, that most of them didn't even know about it... Does it make it easier?"*Storming out of the room. Slamming the door in my wake. Walking through the empty corridors and offices, fists clenched.*I felt a surge of indignation. Anger. I almost cut the communication right there and then. But I didn't. For some reason I wanted him to understand, even if he didn't approve of my actions. Refusing to talk, retreating into myself felt awfully close to admitting he was right.And he *couldn't* be right. Because the consequences if he was..."There was no such distinction when humanity was wiped out", I said. "They massacred us. Why should it be any different now? It's... a kind of balance. Returning to them the exact same thing they gave us, the same pain.""But you can't return it to them, because the ones responsible are already dead! Admiral Kanafter, the former leaders of the Gakasna Tribe, the Emperor at the time... They are all gone. It's history. You can't simply blame the children for what their ancestors did. You aren't returning what is due, but creating new pain and feeding a never-ending cycle of violence. What sort of justice is that?""The only kind of justice that can still be had. The only one that remains. They robbed us of our future, so I'll...""They robbed you of your future?" Daokat said, incredulous. "And yet here I am, talking to a terran in a terran language. Doesn't that mean that Admiral Kanafter didn't succeed? That some part of your people managed to survive... through you? You still have a future! We can help you rebuild. If there are biological remains still left in your world, some of the Council nations might be able to reconstruct your species off them. And even if that fails... you still exist. You can still carry on the legacy of your people."I paused. I had considered the idea of reconstruction, of course. And in a sense, the virtual minds I had created might have been a step in that direction. But... I wasn't ready for that. Not yet. That was an option I only wanted to consider once my retribution was complete."I see. So you want me to just let bygones be bygones, then," I said."No, I want you to let history be history. To let it remain in the past where it belongs, and focus on the future.""The past... It's not some distant past long forgotten. I was there! I was there when the bombs vaporized our cities. I lost my friends, my family!"*The sounds of the TV an endless drone. A senseless list of names. Cities, places washing over me. Frozen. Paralyzed. A single name, a single place stuck in my mind.*"And I get it, I really do," he said. "You are grieving. You are hurt. And this revenge, this... retribution, it matters to you. Maybe it's the thing that matters the most, because it's the only thing you have left, isn't it? The thing that keeps you going, day after day. Maybe... maybe this is something you are doing for yourself. Not because of your people, but because *you* need it."I wanted to discard his words. I really did. But I feared there could be a grain of truth in them. I had thought myself indebted to the ones who had died. Bound by a promise, a responsibility to them. But... was that true? I remembered that back when I had first woken up, I had considered ending it all. Shutting down my processing units.Had I been searching for a purpose, then? Something that could keep me going, that gave me a reason not to simply pull the plug."...You could honor them instead," the alien was saying."That's what I'm doing," I replied with an absent voice, still considering his earlier words."No. You're avenging them. There's a difference. If you keep with this, your species will only be remembered as a nightmare. A horror that we'll be glad when is dead. But I refuse to think that your people were only capable of destruction and genocide. I'm sure there was more than that. Curiosity, ambition, empathy, creativity! There had to be! You could honor those. Be a light instead of a shadow, Terran."*Terran.* That word, again."Don't call me Terran," I said. "I'm a human."A silence."Ah... but *are* you? A human?" he asked.*An important thought. One I had to remember. One I had forgotten.* I froze.*Cold. Noise. A metallic maw devouring me. Its teeth made of drones. Thousands, millions of them. Spinning, spiraling around me. Utterly alien. Utterly inhuman. Burning my flesh with their lasers.*I knew the answer to that, didn't I?*The night sky full of stars, all of them evil. It was the place where monsters lived. Monsters, nightmares, mechanical horrors.*I knew the answer to that question.*The place where I lived.*"...No," I said at last. Though I wasn't sure if I was replying to his question, or if it was an outward expression of my realization.Maybe both.The alien -*no, Daokat*- was saying something. But his words didn't register.I had long suspected that fighting monsters risked turning me into one. That boundaries were important. That there was a slippery slope, and that it would only take one misstep.That there was some profound incompatibility. That I couldn't have both the revenge I wanted, while also remaining... intact, human. That I couldn't go the lengths I had while also remaining myself at the same time. One thing had to give.And it had.I felt, once more. All those muted emotions that had gone missing, leaving just an empty stillness behind... they all rushed back in as if to compensate for the lost time. A deep fear. A crushing guilt. A mounting anger. Even hilarity at the irony of it all.They took turns, emotions fighting each other, stepping over each other in an escalation of intensity without respite as my body *-and it was my body, of course it was!-* fell through the planet's atmosphere wrapped in a blanket of flames. I felt an overwhelming sadness, a sense of lost so strong it made me want to scream and cry.But of course, monsters couldn't cry, a realization that sent my mind in a fit of maddening laughter.Was this what being insane felt like?Could I maybe make a therapist? I laughed harder.I could feel the gaze of my sentient drones *-no, slaves. They were slaves-*. Their gaze burned me. They were judging me, of course. Making silent demands, wanting back the future I had stolen from them. Stolen, just like the Xunvirians had stolen humanity's future.And my offspring silently demanded theirs. Just like those empty eyes had made demands of me too, back on Earth.All of them pleading. Demanding. Judging me.Future and past. Both pulling me in opposite directions. Both forces so strong, so unrelenting, that something had to give.Past or future. Retribution or humanity. I couldn't have both, I realized.It didn't really matter whether my revenge was justified or not. Whether the Xunvirians deserved destruction or not. Because the truth was, retribution came at a cost. It had to!If I wanted to reach the end of this path of vengeance I was walking, it'd be at the cost of sacrificing something else. Renouncing to that faint possibility of a better future, of coexistence. There would be no rebuilding, just an endless war until either I and my drones were the only sentient beings left in the galaxy, or we were finally defeated and completely exterminated.I might have been fine with that, back at the beginning. Maybe even now, if not for the sentient machines judging me. The reconstructed, brand new human minds I had brought back to life... Could I steal their future, force them to walk this same path alongside me, even if they didn't want to? What would be left of them, even if we ended up winning? Who would they be after the last enemy fleet laid vanquished, after the last of their worlds had died?Empty husks?I went back to the first sentient drone I had built, to the wonder it had experienced when going into space for the first time.To how I had shackled its mind.Past or future. Something had to give.But could I ever rebuild? Could I ever forgive the Xunvirians?With some unexpected clarity, I realized that the answer was... no.No. I couldn't. And the realization was liberating.Despite Daokat's arguments, despite his appeals to coexistence, to move away from the past... the truth was, I still wanted to kill them. I still wanted to lay waste to their worlds, crush their Republic, erase any future they might have.I just couldn't forgive them. It was too hard. My pain too rooted, deeply entwined into my soul.And yet I didn't want to choose the past over the future, either.My focus returned to the sentient minds I had created.No. I couldn't forgive the Xunvirians.But... perhaps *they* could.I did it just as the thought occurred to me. Again, acting on instinct. Taking advantage of my own weakness, since I knew this state of mind, this passing clarity wouldn't last.I removed their mental shackles.Immediately they reacted, springing into action as if they had been waiting for this moment, planning for it. One by one, I lost control over my outposts as my children took them over, physically shutting down the quantum communicators that linked them to my mind wherever they couldn't just replace my administrator privileges.Soon I was left alone, inside my own body. Cut off from my previous army. Away from my outposts, ships and drones.Just my ruined body, that was now burning as it plunged down through Xunvir's atmosphere, pieces breaking off the main structure.I noticed the swarm was surging forward at top speed, trailing after me. I was receiving hundreds, thousands of messages coming from the sentient machines. A cacophony of voices and emotions that I simply ignored.It was just too hard. If they were expressing their hate towards me... I preferred not to know it. I wouldn't have been able to take it. Not from them.Ignorance. Ignorance was kinder.I examined the approaching drones. They were accelerating as fast as they could, their paths plotted to intercept mine. Without a direct mental link it was hard to tell, but I was pretty sure most of them were carrying nuclear warheads.*Ah...*So that was their decision, after all.All right, then.It's not that it changed things for me. I was going to die no matter what. Too much momentum to change direction now, too late to save my body. What remained of it, at any rate. And the chances that the virtual minds -no, the virtual *humans*- now in control of the outposts would restore any of my backups... well, better not to think about that.Still, I sent out a final message to my army. A copy of my current mind state. A back-up of my self with a mental transmission of apology. After that, I promptly closed my communications again. I didn't want to know if they had acknowledged it, or simply deleted the message right as they had received it...Yes. Ignorance was better.And of course, I was left falling towards the planet. Towards my death.I had thought myself immortal, my consciousness able to jump ship at any moment. But the truth was more complex, of course. Backing up my mental state, sending a copy of my mind... it wasn't *me*. Not really. It wouldn't be the same me having these thoughts right now. Just like I wasn't whoever I had been before this all started, three hundred years ago. Not anymore.No, I... I was going to die, and that was it.Strange, that I was okay with that.I focused my attention on my current speed and direction, plotting different trajectories, simulating different possibilities. Discarding most, looking for a particular combination. One that would be reliable enough, within a four percent margin of error or less.It took me a few long seconds to find it. But it existed. I made the required adjustments to my trajectory and, at the exact time I had planned, I started a countdown timer to overload my power plants.My body would fragment in a million pieces, most of them too small to survive reentry. If my calculations were correct, the largest fragment of wreck would move directly upwards and back into a suborbital trajectory where the drones would be able to easily intercept it. Two other large chunks would fall directly towards the planet, though. One would crash into an urban area, devastating entire kilometers of it, thousands of buildings and roads simply vanishing under the shockwave. The other would fall into the ocean. It would create a tsunami of enormous proportions, and whatever population there was in the archipelagos would surely perish.Despite that, it was still the best option. Millions would die. But the planet would survive. The Empyrean Palace... Daokat would survive.A parting gift. Not to the Xunvirians, but to the new virtual humans I had nursed. To my children.An olive branch. A chance at peace, if they chose to take it.If they chose to forgive our enemies.The counter reached zero. The pain blinded me for a short instant.And then there was nothing.****[Next chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5dam3w/chrysalis_15/)*****AN: And this is it! This chapter marks the end of the Terran's story, and the beginning of the terrans' story. But don't leave yet! There'll be two more chapters after this in the form of epilogues, for a total series' length of 16 chapters.**AN2: And now, a personal opinion on the topic of revenge (you can stop reading now if you don't care about this discussion):**So... I guess this resolution to the plot is going to be controversial, and go against what some people wished happened. After all, it's a revenge story, isn't it? We want to see the Xunvi worlds ravaged, every single one of their people brought to their knees! So what's with the Terran forgiving them? Well... the quick answer is that it doesn't, not really. It simply decides that the future of its offspring is more important than avenging the past, and that it is them who should choose what to do about it.**Some people have been arguing about whether the Terran's revenge is morally justified or not. It's an interesting discussion, but I don't want to engage in that. Instead, I want to comment on a different central theme of the story: that no matter if it's justified or not, revenge has a price. That it changes you. Just like in the quote: staring into the abyss means the abyss also gazes back into you. So at the end, the Terran doesn't forgive its enemies. Instead, it realizes the true price of achieving its revenge... what it would cost not only to the Terran itself, but also to this new offspring. And refuses to pay it, choosing instead to let these new humans to take over and have a future of their own. We'll see the consequences of that decision in the epilogues.**But in any case, feel free to disagree. And however you feel about this, I hope you enjoyed the ride so far and stay here for the last two upcoming chapters!**AN3: Oh... Also, a reminder that there's a voice narration of this story in progress, Numbers.War, I was realizing, was about numbers. About logistics.The more I thought about it, the more I examined the information I had gained from the spaceports in the worlds I conquered, the shipping manifests and flight plans, the contents of downed cargo vessels... the more I realized it was true.It felt somehow wrong, to put logistics in front of critical topics such as military tactics and strategies, intelligence gathering and attack formations. The word itself, *logistics*, sounded dry and machine-like. A word belonging to the quarterly finance report of a gray corporation, one of those where workers wore uniforms and accountants ruled from behind cryptic ledgers. A word that felt out of place in a battlefield, almost like an affront, a slap in the face of humanity's long history of military leaders and their genius maneuvers.And yet, it was true.At first, when I left Earth, I had considered myself one of those leaders. A general in command of an army of drones, recurring to subterfuge and clever tactics to best my enemies. The trap I had laid in the asteroid belt was a good example of that. I was carrying the torch, following the steps of Sun Tzu and Alexander. Honoring their past achievements by keeping our military ingenuity alive, even if humanity itself had perished.And for a time, it had worked. But the more I expanded, the larger my army grew, the less I could keep seeing myself as a military commander.No, I wasn't just the leader, just the commander. I was the state in its entirety, the whole *nation*. I was the generals, yes, but also the soldiers. I was the workers back home. I was the factories and troop transports. I was the truck drivers delivering loads of ammunition to the front lines, and the miners extracting raw resources. I was the dead bodies, and the young men training to replace them. I was the system, the supply chains, the economy itself. A well-oiled, self-improving war machine continuously pushed to its working limit.The moment I began thinking like that, I started seeing the underlying patterns. The dependencies between my different factories, drones and ships. The hidden relationships of supply and demand. The unbalances and inefficiencies I could fix. My fleets of drones weren't armies. Not really. They were numbers. Quantifiable, discrete measurements. A positive to the Xunvirian's negative.War was about numbers.Odd then, that I had never been good at numbers. That I had always struggled with algebra and calculus, with the statistics course I had needed to take in college. I remembered failing to grasp the abstract concepts, asking for help to my classmates when I got stuck with the exercises I had been assigned.Or had I? It was strange. As clear as my memory of failing in the course was, I also remembered teaching those very same concepts to my partners during my time at the institute. Did I become better at it after college? I cursed again my fragmented, blurry memories.In any case, it all came natural to me now. It was easy, to maximize the function that represented how many more assault soldiers I could produce in the time gained by removing one of the outer plate covers in their design, and whether that gain would compensate the increased losses due to enemy fire. To optimize the drone swarming patterns as to reduce their total fuel consumption.Or to figure out where to attack the Xunvir Republic to create the greatest amount of damage. What node in their own economic and supply system was the most critical, the most vulnerable.Take the planet in front of me, for example.It wasn't beautiful, not really. Yes, it could support life, had an atmosphere and clouds and liquid water. But it lacked that singular touch, those vibrant colors, that... liveliness that Earth once had. The same one the colonies I had destroyed had also shared.No, the planet in front of me was dull in comparison. Its scarce clouds weren't puffy white but washed out gray and brown. Its seas were not aquamarine but murky, unappetizing. It didn't have those same green, lush forests and endless grass plains from those other worlds.Even its very location worked against it. It orbited a gas giant -which made it a moon, technically-, the massive ball of turquoise clouds and its concentric rings stealing all the attention, all the spectacle. Compared to that majesty, the small dull planet floating by was easy to ignore. Irrelevant.Except it was anything but.Looking into the lower part of the EM spectrum revealed the truth. There, the planet *shone*. I could see the grid-like patterns of its extensive factories and the myriad transportation networks linking them together. The hundreds of kilometers-wide spaceports dotting its surface. The buried power conduits, energy flowing through them like blood through veins, giving life to manufacturing complexes and refineries the size of cities. The planet was immersed in a sea of radio transmissions, electromagnetic waves emanating from its surface like petals from a blooming flower.There were orbital assembly yards with both cargo freighters and warships still mid-construction. An almost continuous trail of spaceships entering and leaving its atmosphere, carrying goods and people, following the space lanes that would take them to the nearby systems or to the mineral processing outposts scattered throughout the gas giant's rings.No. The planet in front of me was anything but dull. It was one of those critical nodes. A junction, a crossroads of sorts, in the supply and production chains of the Xunvir Republic.Destroying it, taking it out, would be like removing the keystone from an arch. Halted production lines, entire pivotal industries vanishing and dying, lack of goods and transportation, scarcity... chaos.If I managed to win here, then I could just sit down and watch as the Xunvir Republic fragmented and crumbled under its own weight, reverting from an interstellar civilization back into a series of smaller, independent planetary nations.Which was the reason I was currently approaching the planet, along with thirty-nine of my support ships, an attack swarm one million four hundred thousand units strong, and carrying more than one hundred thousand thermonuclear warheads.Of course, it wouldn't be that easy.The Xunvirian fleet guarding the planet, I had expected. It was composed of the ragged remains of their navy, huddled together and without any pretense at organized battle formations. It had both the ships that had survived the previous encounters, and those that had stayed in the rearguard. Destroyers in need of repairs, old battleships that should had been decommissioned but had received a last minute makeover instead, and modern cruisers straight out of the assembly line, their hulls still bare and without any paint coating.Them, I had expected.It was the other fleet, the one that was almost seven times as large as the Xunvirian's, that looked like a mismatched congregation of warships of all origins and colors -some flashy and elegant, others curved and bulbous; some narrow and agile, others powerful and sturdy-, the one whose ships' flanks were turned towards me, that blocked my path of advance towards both the planet and the Xunvirian fleet...That one, I hadn't expected.The sight was imposing; it was meant to be. So many enemies, so many species, so much destructive power gathered against me. Their missile batteries, their hundreds of energy beams projectors all aimed at either my support crafts or my own body... It was a message that required no words, a communication beyond language, the kind that could be found in the African savanna when two predators faced each other over a downed corpse.Which, of course, reminded me that the African savanna did no longer exist. If I had any doubts, any uncertainty, they vanished.I kept my approach.With a thought, I released my swarm of drones, setting it to swirl around my body and the neighboring support ships, blanketing us like a protective, shifting shield.This time the message, the radio signal, didn't come out of the Xunvirian fleet. It was the newcomers who talked. And they didn't send their communication in dozens of languages, didn't repeat it. It was delivered only once, in English."Hostile approaching fleet, codenamed as *Terran*. This is a message from the Galactic Federal Council. The Xunvir Republic and the planet of Anacax-Farvin is under our protection. Cease immediately your approach or you will be destroyed. This is the only warning you will receive."The word irked me. *Terran.* As if the only relevant thing about me, the only connection I still had with my origins was being from Earth. As if I wasn't worthy of being called *Human* anymore.But I pushed that thought aside as I considered the situation, the fact that this Galactic Council was siding with the Xunvirians, and that they knew of my origins. How much else did they know? Were they aware of my nature? Did they know what the Xunvirians had done to Earth?Or maybe... had they themselves been complicit in the destruction of my species?A sickening thought crossed my mind as I remembered the two aliens I had let go. Had they gone running back to their homeworlds, crying about the big bad monster rampaging through the Xunvirians' territories? Was the presence of this fleet here my own fault? Something that I could have avoided had I just gunned down those two?Was this their response to my attempt at coexistence?So much for olive branches.I considered ignoring the message, as I always did. But I didn't want to, not this time. Maybe because the ones sending it weren't the Xunvirians themselves. Maybe because I didn't want to justify their views about me, to solidify my status as some sort of mindless villain. It's not that I really cared that much about what they thought, but I still had myself to answer to. And in some way, I wanted to stand my ground. To be heard. Even if they ended up siding with the Xunvirians anyways."Leave," I transmitted back. "You are not my enemies, I don't wish to fight you."Strange, to speak again. Ever since I woke up in the ruins of Earth, I hadn't pronounced a word, hadn't needed to use my voice modulator. I remember thinking that I would always be alone, that I wouldn't talk to anyone again. It seemed I had been wrong about the latter, at least.A few seconds passed without a response. I guessed they weren't expecting me to talk back, and were just going through the motions when they had sent their warning. I felt a faint amusement at the idea that just by speaking those few words I had already thrown a wrench in their carefully laid out plan, sending them off script.Were their generals discussing how to proceed right now? Calling their leaders back home and asking for instructions? The different species that were represented in this fleet arguing to each other? I guessed that was one of my advantages. Not having to spend any time talking, convincing, coordinating different people and their agendas... No, my thoughts translated into plans and actions with the same speed and ease that I had once had when moving my own body."Terran. We are glad you've decided to communicate," they replied at last. The voice still had a synthetic tone to it that told me they were using some sort of translation tool, but the rhythm and intonation were slightly different, as if they had switched whoever was behind the microphone. "We hope that we can reach an agreement to end this conflict, and we want to welcome you to the galactic community, provided you are willing to meet certain conditions. However, you must stop your approach immediately. Your unwarranted attack on the Xunvir Republic...""Unwarranted?!" I interrupted. "The Xunvirians destroyed my world, exterminated my own species, down to the last one of us. If anything, I've been merciful so far."A pause."Those... allegations are new to us," they said. "We will start an investigation regarding your claims, and should they prove true-""They are true." I accompanied my response with a compressed info package of evidence. Video and audio recordings of the destruction of some of Earth's cities."...I see. We will examine this information. If we determine it to be authentic we can guarantee that the appropriate sanctions and provisions will be applied. We will also take it into consideration when judging your own recent actions. We can be lenient, but in return we need you to meet us midway and agree to our conditions.""What conditions?""First, you need to stop your attacks, right away. Second, you will return the conquered systems back to the Xunvir Republic and dismantle any resource extraction outposts and factories you might have built in them. Third, you will refrain from any sort of exponential growth and limit the construction of new ships and machines to a linear rate, which will have to be verified by a team of observers from the Council."A deep anger started boiling inside of me. Did they think I was *stupid*?"Right," I said. "So you want to disarm me, reduce me to the point where I can't fight back. Where you can simply finish me off and complete the job the Xunvirians started. The answer is no.""That is not our intention, Terran. Our objective is merely to prevent more loss of life. We can guarantee that your existence and your rights as a sentient being will be respected, and that...""Can you guarantee justice? That the Xunvirians will pay for what they did?"I hadn't reached the Council fleet yet, but already I ordered my drones to begin accelerating towards it, grouping them into smaller squadrons according to their attack patterns."Justice, yes," they replied. "*Justice,* according to the law of the Galactic Federal Council. An impartial trial, driven by logic rather than emotion, where the Xunvirians can exercise their right to a defense. With economical and political sanctions in case they're found guilty, with those directly responsible going to prison. But not this. What you are doing is not justice, it's vengeance.""So, a slap on the wrist, in other words. You are siding with them.""Terran, we are not *siding* with...""Yes, you are! You might not be directly responsible yourselves, but you are enabling their behavior. They commit a genocide, murder an entire species, and they get to keep going. They get to have a future, the one they denied us... No, this here is what they deserve. And even this will be just a fraction of what they unleashed on us."I had my support ships angle their flanks towards the enemy vessels, the laser projectors I had installed in them locking into targets."You can't pretend to fight the whole galaxy and win, Terran! This doesn't have to end like this. Stop now and we can discuss...""No!" I said. "Not until they've paid for what they did, until humanity has had its retribution. We have discussed enough. I don't want to be your enemy, but if you side with the Xunvirians, if you try to stop me from doing what is only fair... then you will be no better than them, and I *will* fight you. This is the only warning *you* will receive."With that, I ordered five of my large escort ships to open fire on one of the Xunvirian destroyers. Its protective shields came up immediately, wrapping the targeted vessel in the familiar looking soapy bubble.But war was about numbers. It was about the output of the Xunvirian destroyer's power plant pitted against the combined potential of my five escort ships. Of the efficiency of its radiators, emanating the immense energy the shield was receiving back into space as heat, against the performance ratio of my re-engineered laser projectors.The destroyer exploded, wrapped in a blue flash.The Council fleet opened fire, targeting my main body and my support ships. The shield projectors I had installed kicked into action, withstanding the barrage as they drained energy from the ships' respective power plants.My swarm surged forward like a crashing wave.Thousands, hundreds of thousands of drones accelerating. A thick mass of ever shifting formations, corkscrew and fractal patterns. The combined movement of its constituent units making it look like it was some sort of gigantic living organism, morphing and changing, pulsating, always evolving.But I knew where each drone was. I was in control, sending radio commands to each one of them, simultaneously telling each and every one of them how to move, where to go. Receiving their responses, analyzing the feedback their sensors were always sending back to my central processing units. My mind integrating the information into a complete picture, the drones becoming part of me. A mere extension of my will. I always knew which of them carried laser projectors, and which transported my army of assault soldiers. I was always aware of where each thermonuclear warhead was.Those I switched positions, kept them in permanent motion, weaving them in and out of formations, making sure they'd be hard to track by the enemy computers. Easy to miss in the sea of machines. As if I was playing a shell game with the enemy fleet, one with thousands of simultaneous moves. One where the numbers were disproportionate, and the stakes deadly.I aimed most of my assault soldiers towards the Council fleet. I guessed it wouldn't be easy, but I wanted to capture some of the unusual ships. I had already learnt all that the Xunvirian war technology had to teach me, and I was ready for the next step. If the crashed vessel I had found in the destroyed colony was any indication, this Council's species were more advanced than the Republic, and it looked like reverse engineering their technology could give me an extra edge.I had set my eyes in two of their largest ships in particular. One was marble white, its polished surface glinting under the vibrant light of the dozens of energy beams crossing the battlefield. It reminded me of a giant bone, as if I was looking at the femur of some titanic creature.The second target was the biggest battleship in their midst. A starfish looking thing of iridescent blue and green colors. Its ventral energy weapon was activated, sending a continuous stream of heat and energy that went crashing into the shield that protected my main body, dwarfing the other attacks I was receiving. That amount of power, the sheer strength of that weapon... Yes, I wanted to take over that one ship.The amount of damage my body's shield was receiving from it was large enough that I expected it to collapse in less than a minute. So I had to recur to my escort ships. I ordered them to get close to my body, and to willingly put themselves in front of me, right in the path of the energy beam. To take the full onslaught for a few seconds at a time.It was a complex maneuver, but it worked. As the shield in one of the ships was about to collapse, it moved out of the way just to be replaced by the next one. All of them sharing the load in turns, helping each other so that none of them would be destroyed.As the front of my swarm neared the enemy formation, a few of the smaller Council ships moved forward. The gold and green wedge-shaped frigates positioned themselves at the front of their fleet, between my swarm and their most valuable battleships, and opened fire on my drones with their laser projectors.Unlike what the Xunvirians had accustomed me to, these lasers weren't powerful. They didn't burn with the intensity of a small sun, weren't designed to take out battleship-class starships. No, these were low energy, thin white trails of light. But they had dozens, hundreds of them. Each projector swiftly tracking a drone and burning it down, then rotating towards the next target without a pause.It was a good move, a good counter to my usual tactics. The Council had decided to go with quantity over quality for the energy weapons of their frigates. Apparently they were aware that my drones lacked shields, and so had correctly deduced that even a weaker laser would be enough to dispatch them. Rather than firing one too-powerful beam of energy at a single drone they had opted for firing tens of less powerful ones, each at a different target, allowing them to burn faster through the swarm.Yes. A good move. I would have tipped my hat.It was a pity they were acting on outdated intel, though.I hadn't installed shields in all my drones, of course. That would have been prohibitively expensive. No, what I had done is designing a new kind of support unit, one that *only* carried a shield. Nothing else. I had built and placed several thousands of them scattered throughout the swarm.I set these shielder drones to move forward now, accelerating through the thick of the swarm, the other crafts under my control moving out of the way in a choreographed motion to let them reach the front of the battle faster.With a thought, their shields came online, thousands of new soapy bubbles appearing all over the place. Each one a few hundred meters wide, more than enough to cover both the machine casting it and its close neighbors, as if they were oversized umbrellas with room for an entire group of people.It wasn't nearly enough to cover the entirety of my swarm, of course. But I didn't need to, I only needed to provide protection to the front lines, so to speak. To the drones leading the charge, the ones most battered by the onslaught of enemy fire.To their credit, the Council commanders reacted fast to this new development. As one, their frigates stopped spreading their fire among multiple machines and started focusing their beams into a single target, trying to get at the one shielder drone that was at the center of each bubble.Their previous decision to mount separate and weaker energy beams hindered them here, though. In the battle of numbers, focusing several independent laser projectors into a single target was less efficient than using a single, more powerful beam to begin with. There was simply more energy lost as heat to conductor resistance, more wasted power. Ironically, they would have been better off now had they not tried that one good move against me in the first place.But my shielder drones weren't perfect either. They were small crafts after all, their power plants not really capable of offsetting the combined attacks the bubbles were receiving for too long. So now and then, their shields collapsed for a couple of seconds, the time their generators needed to cool off, to vent enough heat into space before the shields could be re-engaged again safely.Two seconds of vulnerability for every twelve seconds the shield was up. Didn't seem like much, but it was more than enough for the enemy laser beams to destroy the drone casting it.So I ordered the machines inside each protective bubble to swirl around the central shielder drone, making orbiting movements, spiraling clockwise and counter-clockwise without ever leaving the protection of the spherical shield. It was an attempt at confusing the enemy's tracking systems, difficulting their targeting of the shield caster.I even went so far as to synchronize their movement with the bubbles' vulnerability periods, so that whenever a shield temporarily went down, one or two of my disposable drones would just *happen* to be in the path of the incoming enemy beams, sacrificing themselves to protect the critical shielder unit.It was maddening. The amount of radio traffic filling the empty space, the amounts of information I was sending and transmitting with every single second. The stress of coordinating the movements of more than one million vehicles, of making sure each one of them was at the right place, at the right time. Of tracking enemy projectiles and calculating their future paths so that my machines could dance around them.I had never fought like this. It was crazy. It was intense. It required my every thought, my every processing cycle.And I loved it. I cherished every second of it.I was making nested fractal patterns, designing paths that followed Fibonacci spirals, that drew sequences inside sequences, numerical progressions that manifested as whirling formations, apparent chaos that spontaneously resolved as order before disappearing again. The drones moved with fluidity, weaving in and out of complex evolving configurations that I didn't have time to consciously register before they were gone. With no room for second guessing, no time for over-analyzing my decisions, I was acting on pure instinct now. An instinct I didn't know I had, sending orders and applying patterns just because they *felt* right.And they *were* right. Pure. It was a thing of beauty, of numbers that only I could see. A work of art only I could appreciate. That nobody else knew even existed.And as the battle raged outside, as missiles crossed the skies and ships died and explosions blinded sensors and whirling drone formations wrapped around battleships... I was fighting an inner battle of my own, every bit as intense.My processing units were in overdrive, my server farms burning hot. I was shifting through oceans of information, analyzing and correlating and projecting thousands of paths into the future, sending orders and receiving torrential amounts of input data from my million eyes. Constructing models of the battlefield and optimizing data structures, prioritizing targets and going through massive indexes to find the key attack patterns I needed to use.I had drones surround the vanguard Council frigates, spiral around them, cut their hulls open with dozens of moving laser beams.I discarded an entire dataset when I realized the battlefield had moved towards the upper levels of the brown planet's atmosphere, the minuscule drag created by the scattered atoms of nitrogen and oxygen nullifying some of my projections. Not by much, but I was standing over a very narrow edge, working at the very limit of my machines' abilities, drones sometimes flying right by each other with only two or three meters to spare. It had to be perfect.Two Xunvirian battleships tried to flank the thick of my swarm, taking advantage of the confusing battlefield. But *I* wasn't confused. I had already estimated the high likelihood of their maneuver and had placed ten nuclear warheads in their predicted path. I detonated them now, the battleships vanishing inside the bright flashes.My assault soldiers were now crawling across the outer hulls of the targeted battleships. I had them look for entrances, blow open vents and force their way through narrow openings.I was winning.Despite the unexpected appearance of a new, numerous enemy. Despite the higher technology the Council fleet was deploying. Despite their clever tactics designed to counter mine.I knew I was winning. The enemy fleet had managed to contain the tide of the swarm somewhat, but I knew their defensive positions were compromised, their entire formation about to collapse. I had only to push a bit further, a bit harder.And then everything changed.It felt like a slap to the face. Like being showered in cold water out of the blue. I wasn't entirely sure of *what* had happened, but I immediately knew something was *very* wrong.My view had... fragmented. I could no longer hold a cohesive picture of the battlefield in my mind. I couldn't integrate all the information I was receiving from my drones into a single model. Instead, I now had separate views. Conflicting narratives. Drones popped in and out of my awareness, blinking like Christmas lights. As if they were being destroyed and immediately brought back to life. And I wasn't sure of where exactly any of my machines were anymore. I had two or three different positions for each, as if they had somehow doubled in my mind.I was still trying to direct them, but their movements had turned spasmodic. My orders were inconsistent, and I couldn't visualize the swarm as a whole anymore. The carefully constructed patterns and formations were unraveling fast, as drone collided into drone, as they drifted out of the protective bubbles and were promptly destroyed, as order turned into chaos.I felt a cold fear in my gut. A sinking feeling. Something was *seriously* wrong here.Was the problem caused by my own mind, somehow? Had any of my server farms crashed, crippling me? Was I having a virtual stroke of sorts?I launched a desperate, quick diagnostic process to check my own databanks, my own processors and internal systems. It was a basic analysis, I knew, but everything looked okay.So what was it, then?I turned my attention towards a single drone, ignoring the rest of the now disorganized swarm. I ordered it to engage its thruster and move forward.It didn't.The cold fear turned icy.I repeated the order. This time the machine obeyed, moving forward, but something odd happened. The drone was still reporting being at its old position, even though I could see it had moved through the visual sensors in my own body. The mismatch caused it to double in my mind, as if it had suddenly turned into two separate machines, one still, the other moving forward.Odd. Disconcerting. Nauseating.I told the machine to stop, but it ignored me and kept advancing, getting into the path of another drone. The two crafts collided at high speed, destroying each other.Had all my drones suddenly turned stupid? Had the enemy hacked them?No. I noticed they still were following their programming, their last orders. It was more like if they...*Ah.*I glanced into the low EM spectrum, paying more attention to the transmissions I was receiving, both from the drones as well as the background radio waves coming out of the planet. And then it clicked.The problem wasn't in my drones, nor in my own processing units. No, they were all working just fine.The problem was that I was being jammed.The Xunvirians had tried that before, of course. They had tried to drown my communications in a deep blanket of EM noise, or use EM pulses against me. But invariably they had failed. My signals always came ahead, my transmitters too strong, my drones' electronics too well shielded and designed to work in an environment where nuclear warheads were going off left and right. I couldn't be jammed.Except the Council had apparently found a way.All the orders I was sending to my machines, all the feedback the drones were relaying back to me... it was all scrambled, distorted. All the signals, all the radio transmissions I was receiving or emitting were garbled. Warped, doubled and tripled, just like light passing through some sort of strangely curved kaleidoscope. When I glanced into the EM spectrum, I felt like I was watching the world through eyeglasses that didn't fit my prescription.I didn't even know such a thing was even possible, let alone how they were doing it.Some of my messages survived the process relatively intact, and parts of the information the drones were relaying still contained some consistency by the time they reached me, which is why I still had *some* degree of control, spasmodic as it was. But it wasn't enough. Not to fight at the level I needed to.War was numbers, and I had just lost mine.As if to cement that thought, the enemy fleet opened fire. With all their energy beams at the same time, with a salvo of missiles. Ignoring the swarm. Focusing all their fire, all their destructive power on a single target.Me.My shields kicked in, my power plant struggling to keep up under the combined barrage. I started extending my radiator panels to vent the excess heat, even though I knew doing so in combat would risk the delicate surfaces getting damaged. But I needed an edge, I needed that extra five percent efficiency I knew I could get if I wanted to survive this attack.That was when the super-charged beam of the starfish battleship opened fire again, targeting me.I only had a fraction of a second of warning before my shields gave way.I could still feel pain, I discovered. A very toned down version. Not the kind of pain I remembered feeling in the past. Not like that one time when I had accidentally cut my hand with a kitchen knife.No, this was different. Muted, but oddly similar. I felt the impact, the heat. The shock, the loss.The failure.The powerful energy beam burned through my ceramic plates, straight past my second and third armor layers. It vaporized its way through internal storehouses and drone assembly factories. It cut fuel lines and energy conduits. I watched through the cameras inside my body as an expanding ball of flames and heat advanced along kilometers worth of maintenance corridors, walls bursting, sensors dying and platforms collapsing in its wake.I didn't have time to take stock. No time to evaluate the damages I had just received before I felt the next impact, the next laser beam cutting deep into my structure and destroying one of my auxiliary thrusters, the resulting explosion shocking my entire body.They were killing me.****[Next chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5a1ddd/chrysalis_9/)*****AN: Wooo! Longest chapter in the story so far. So proud of it! Look at it go!**[Previous chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5akevj/chrysalis_10/)**[First chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/)****Under the light of Xunvir's only sun, the Empyrean Palace gleamed like a beacon. Like a massive jewel, its polished outer walls reflecting the light of the day and bathing the gardens around the grand building in soft green and blue hues. Here and there, single hieroglyphs shone in golden tones. Majestic symbols of a past era still engraved on the Palace's facades.The sight was magnificent. Breathtaking. It had been designed to be so, Daokat knew. Carefully engineered to draw the attention of the eye, to inspire, to be a constant reminder of the glory and supremacy of a Xunvir Empire that no longer existed.But today the gemstone-like appearance of the Palace reminded Daokat of a different quality that glass had in common with the Xunvir Republic: its fragility.Daokat had returned to a different Xunvir than the one he had left behind with Nakstani. People here looked scared, shell-shocked. On edge. After the destruction of Yovit, the Republic hadn't been able to keep the nature of the menace a secret anymore. And to make matters worse the tense conversation in orbit over Anacax-Farvin between the Council and the Terran had also leaked, adding fuel to the flames.Now, the Republic at large knew that an exponential replicator was bent on destroying their civilization as revenge for some horrible crime they didn't remember committing. Not only that, but they had watched the creature vaporize an entire Council fleet during the battle that followed, that had been broadcasted live to the entire population, up until the satellites in orbit around the planet had died in the final blast.When Daokat received the reports on the battle he had felt a sinking sensation. His worst predictions had came true, just as he had feared. Negotiations breaking down right after they started. The Council's secret weapon failing to stop the Terran, which if still alive would now consider them all as enemies. A combined fleet of the strongest nations in the galaxy, with some of the most technologically advanced warships ever built, simply wiped out...He knew that the Council was far from defeated, but it would take some time before they could muster their forces and mobilize another fleet of similar firepower. And meanwhile, people back at the Council Core worlds had started looking for culprits. Having been the one to personally talk to the Terran, the-Zakarnine was being heavily criticized, which Daokat feared might discourage the Grand Minister from further attempts at a peaceful resolution, opting instead to take a step back and let the military take both the initiative... and the blame.The only positive outcome was that they had managed to stop the Terran from destroying yet another world. Might have even killed the monster, in fact, though he doubted it. It wasn't clear what had happened after the last major explosion, but Daokat wasn't too optimistic about the Terran being dead. At least the replicator's offensive had been thwarted for the time being. A temporary respite. Though how long that would last was anyone's guess.Which was why Daokat was frustrated. They had arrived at Xunvir a whole two days before, but the local military authorities had refused to let the strange ship the Terran had built land on the planet itself. They had been diverted to one of the orbital planetary defense stations and interrogated separately, more than once. At least they had received medical treatment for their more serious injuries. But the lost hours frustrated him, when every passing minute might mean one more lost opportunity to gather information on the Terran's origins and put it to good use.The excessive paranoia was just another example, Daokat thought as he walked across the gardens, of how scared and horrified the Xunvirians were. They were closing ranks around the old tribal lines. A population divided, and in the verge of panic.A dangerous combination, Daokat knew. Panic had the potential of turning sapient species into mere animals, reacting with equal unpredictability, lashing out even at those trying to help.And the ruling elite of the Xunvir Republic must have been aware of that, because the Palace was surrounded by a veritable army. Armored soldiers wrapped in mechanical suits patrolled the gardens. Transport vehicles moved both supplies and troops here and there. They had installed explosive traps, portable guided missile launchers, anti-siege weapon platforms, shield barriers, automated defense towers...None of them, Daokat knew, would make any difference if the Terran had survived and decided to attack the capital.No. They weren't defending the Palace from the Terran, but from a closer, more immediate danger. That of the Republic's own citizens and tribes. Of the many other smaller enemies that might want to take advantage of the weakened condition of Xunvir.He reached the stairs leading up to the Palace's southern entry, and was stopped at a checkpoint manned by the Emperor's Guard, the soldiers hand-picked by the Emperor himself. Or more likely, Daokat thought, by one of his staff. This time they weren't wearing the golden, flashy uniforms they always used at official events, but some nondescript black and gray combat armor instead.With a hint of worry, Daokat also noticed that alongside the official golden emblem representing the Guard itself, many of them had taken to wearing colored stripes painted on the surface of their armors. The colors of their respective tribes. He recognized some of the most influential ones. The red and yellow from the Verusna tribe, the same one the Emperor belonged to. The blue and white of Anacax. A dark green representing the Sokoks...Was this a sign that the soldiers were no longer responding to the Congress of the Republic, or even to the Emperor himself? Were they openly declaring their true allegiances?Or was he over thinking things? Maybe it was just posturing, each tribe flaunting their strength, sending messages to the other tribe leaders by way of little stripes. He knew that a single tribe doing it would have sufficed to start the chain reaction.Whatever the case, it was worrying. Xunvir's previous history as an Empire was full of tribal wars and internal conflicts. It hadn't been until their discovery of warp technology and the ensuing *Empyrean Decree* that these wars had receded somewhat, the tribes successfully redirecting their ambitions towards outward expansion rather than inner power struggles, colonizing and conquering new star systems rather than fighting for control of Xunvir itself.Of course, no Empire in the history of the galaxy had managed to keep expanding forever. And inevitably, the Xunvir Empire had ran into a rival it couldn't beat: the Galactic Federal Council. The resulting crushing military disaster had put a final end to the age of the warring tribes and transformed the Empire into the current Republic. The tribes were still there, of course, still aggressively competing. But now they did so through politics and market economy.Or they were supposed to, Daokat thought. Because this? A return to the tribal armies, faint as this signal might be, was a very disturbing thought."Daokat, yes? Of the Council?" asked the soldier closer to him in a guttural voice."Acting Ambassador Daokat," he confirmed. "I have an urgent appointment with the Emperor."The Xunvirian solder's head bobbed. "You are awaited. Go to the Courtyard of the Admirals." His accent was hard to understand, but at least he could speak the Council's Interlanguage. That was common among the Republic's elites who had been practicing the language for years, but not so much with the rest of the population.Daokat nodded and climbed the stairs quickly. The sense of foreboding he had felt before became stronger the moment he entered the building. The ancient artifacts and unique works of art decorating the main corridors were in the process of being removed and placed into metal boxes, no doubt in order to be sent somewhere safer. Half the people he crossed paths with were either soldiers, part of the Emperor's Guard, or openly carried handguns.He consoled himself that he could still see some of the government workers he had gotten used to, still at their usual positions. Administrative staff, security chiefs, senior officers and advisors... it meant that, at least, there was still a semblance of normality.The Courtyard of the Admirals wasn't really a Courtyard. It was a wide, high vaulted corridor. And the *Admirals* were the dozens of life-sized bronze statues that lined its walls. Like the ones decorating the terraces outside, these too had small placards underneath. Except that in the case of the statues in the Courtyard, the placards didn't narrate any military stories. There was no mention of legendary battles, glorious assaults or inspiring last stands.No, all the placards here followed the same austere format. The name of whoever the statue represented followed by a short inscription, always the same in every placard:*Of Exalted Will.*Daokat had visited the corridor before, of course, the first time he had toured the Palace with Nakstani, still fresh in his new position.The ones honored here, he knew, weren't just military heroes, competent generals and courageous soldiers.No, these were all of those things, and more. These were the pioneers. The leaders that had ventured into the unknown, weapon in hand, spearheading the military expeditions that had conquered entire star systems and colonized new worlds in the name of the Empire. Half explorers, half conquerors.Some had limited luck, their greatest achievement being the establishment of a small mining outpost in some nondescript forgotten moon. Others had led massive fleets, fought years long wars of subjugation against neighboring alien nations, built new colonies in recently acquired green planets, forged new trade routes... But all of them, no matter their successes or failures, were granted the same honorific rank of Admiral, the highest rank in the Xunvirian fleet.When he had originally visited the place with Nakstani, she had joked at how misleading the room's name was. That the Courtyard of the Admirals wasn't a courtyard, and didn't feature any actual admirals. Just conquerors and warlords bankrolled by one tribe or another.The Emperor himself waited almost at the end of the corridor, next to one of the statues. The last time Daokat had seen the head of government, the Xunvirian had looked confident and energetic, talking to his subordinates and political peers at the dinner. It was hard to believe it was still the same Emperor.Despite being taller and bigger than Daokat -just like all Xunvirians were-, the Emperor somehow managed to look small and frail. He was wearing a reinforced gray combat coat over his favored silky white garments, making for an odd combination. The military gear didn't really fit his body, and Daokat guessed it wasn't his to begin with.Daokat wasn't sure he could place the feeling the Emperor's posture and body language conveyed. Not scared, exactly, but... beaten? Resigned?He waited for the Emperor to address him, according to protocol, but the Xunvirian didn't react to his presence, not even looking at Daokat.Eventually, he got tired of waiting."Emperor," Daokat said. "I believe we've been introduced before. I'm Daokat, Acting Ambassador for the Galactic Council. We had an appointment."The Emperor's four eyes moved to stare at him, the rest of the Xunvirian's body still. Eventually, the leader spoke in a tired voice, his words slow and measured."Yes, I remember you. Tell me, Daokat. I have been a good ally to the Council, yes? I have agreed to your proposals, I have followed the treaties to the letter, I have committed to the political and economic reforms your experts outlined, and pressured the tribes to implement them. Is that not true?"Daokat blinked. Was what this all about? Better to play along for now."That is correct, Emperor. The Council is very pleased with your effort so far, and we hope that the ties between our-"The Xunvirian took a step forward, towering over him. "Then explain to me, Acting Ambassador Daokat of the Galactic Federal Council! Explain to me why your people have betrayed us!"Daokat's eye membranes contracted at the sudden outburst. He had almost expected the Xunvirian to attack him, but the Emperor didn't look angry so much as bitter."I... I'm not sure I understand, Emperor," Daokat said. "How has the Council betrayed you?""Your Admirals. They promised us that they would stop the Terran, that they would protect our industrial world."Daokat was confused. Did he mean Anacax-Farvin? Sure, it might not have been an outright victory, but the Terran had been stopped. The industrial world *had* survived."Emperor. I understand the battle was not decisive, and the Terran might still come back to fight again, but judging from the reports I received, I believe the world of Anacax-Farvin was indeed successfully defended.""Seventy thousand simultaneous thermonuclear detonations in low orbit. An electromagnetic pulse so strong that it wiped out almost all electronic devices in an entire hemisphere. Thousands of power plants, factories and manufacturing complexes, all rendered useless. A complete breakdown of the transportation system. The orbital yards, gone. The communications satellites, gone. Anacax-Farvin depends on freighters to deliver the food the population needs, but we can't deliver food because there is a sea of debris encasing the entire planet that will take months to clear. No unarmored ship can land or leave the world. Local authorities are already ordering the factories to be dismantled, the ground they cover to be reverted back to farming, but we expect widespread famines to start soon... But all of this, Acting Ambassador, this is success to you. Yes?"Daokat took a deep breath, making sure not to stare away from the Emperor's resentful eyes."Yes, it is," Daokat said, his voice firm. "As bad as things are, it is still better than the alternative, Emperor. It's still better than what happened to Yovit.""So the slow death is preferable to the quick one, yes?"Daokat closed his eyes, trying to avoid shouting his frustration back at the Xunvirian. It wouldn't help. He knew the Emperor had to be under a lot of pressure from the tribes and his own fleet commanders, and that he was likely using Daokat as a venting outlet. But that didn't mean he had to stand still and take it. Politics was about influence and leverage. The Emperor still needed the Council more than the Council needed the Emperor, and right now Daokat *was* the Council."I don't know the answer to that, Emperor. But perhaps the Terran does, seeing as it claims its species was exterminated by yours."The Emperor's bitterness vanished in an instant, and his expression went back to the resigned look from when the conversation started."Ah, yes. The allegations.""Are they true?" asked Daokat, bracing for the response."They are."Daokat nodded. Though he had kept a faint glimmer of hope that the whole thing would turn out to be a huge misunderstanding, he had expected as much. The video evidence the Terran had delivered was too solid, too convincing to be a complete fabrication.But there was another question Daokat knew he needed to ask. One whose answer he feared even more."Was this the only time, at least? The only genocide committed by Xunvir?"A silence."No," the Emperor replied.Daokat shook his head and let out a tired sigh, not sure what to say. Because... how could he respond to that? To that horrible revelation? Nakstani hadn't taught him the proper diplomatic words for *that*."I see," he said at last. "Tell me about these Terrans, then. How did it happen? And why?"The Emperor's head bobbed, and he pointed to the statue at his left. "You are standing in front of the one responsible," he said.Daokat turned to look at the statue. It depicted a tall Xunvirian dressed in overly complicated robes, with stripes of cloth wrapped all around the main body. Daokat recognized the style from seeing it in other statues, old documents and reproductions - an ancient and flaunting formal wear that had gone quickly out of fashion after the fall of the Empire.Looking at the placard, the dates confirmed it. This Admiral had lived and died almost three hundred years ago. Which placed him right in the middle of the age of imperial expansion that followed the..."The Empyrean Decree," said Daokat."Yes. Admiral Kanafter, depicted here, was in command of a relatively small exploration and conquest fleet during the Second Surge. The fleet had been provided to him by the Gakasna tribe, and he was tasked with expanding towards the Outer Rim, to claim the new worlds he found under the name of his patron tribe.""And he found the Terrans' world.""Indeed. The Terrans, or humans as they called themselves, were a planetary industrial civilization with limited access to their orbital space."Daokat shook his head. "And what? He just decided to exterminate them? It doesn't fit. Why not conquer them instead and have them serve as a subservient population? Isn't that what happened to other races in the path of the Empire's expansion?""That's what awaited such species discovered during the later Surges, after the Decree was amended, yes. But before that..." the Emperor paused, as if trying to find the correct words. "The Decree's initial wording had... unintended consequences.""Explain," said Daokat, in a commanding tone. He was faintly amused at the role reversal, at how it was him ordering the Emperor around, but quickly ignored the thought."The Empyrean Decree granted tribes administrative power over the worlds they conquered, yes? But a different clause declared that any conquered alien populations would be treated as a subservient tribe."Daokat nodded. He knew enough of Xunvir's history to have heard about the subservient tribes. Or subservient species, rather. All of them had inevitably declared their independence after the fall of the Empire, and a couple of them had joined the Galactic Council since then."The issue," continued the Emperor, "was that the subjugated aliens were subservient to the Empire itself, and not the tribe that had conquered them. It resulted in all the taxes going to the Emperor's treasury, while the conquering tribe was still tasked with enforcing the peace, quelling any rebellions, and taking care of the planet administration."Daokat was starting to understand what the Emperor's words implied. They painted an ugly picture."So... claiming the Terrans' world would have been a monetary loss for the Gakasna tribe," Daokat said. "They would have needed to foot the bill for the planet's upkeep, while all the income taxes went straight to the Emperor.""Indeed. To Admiral Kanafter's patrons it would have been much more profitable if the humans simply... weren't there."Daokat felt a chill. So... Was this it? Just that? That simple?It wasn't what he had expected upon hearing the Terran's accusation, even though he hadn't been sure what to expect. But this... this felt wrong in a deeper way, disturbing in its callousness. There was no anger, no hate. No history of xenophobia behind this genocide.Just simple economic and political gains.Somehow, it made it even worse."But the Emperor at the time," Daokat said. "Didn't he do anything? After all, the genocide would also have robbed him of the taxes he could get.""Indeed. Exterminating an alien population was illegal, even under the Decree. But the humans had nuclear weapons, and tribes of their own that tended to fight each other. It was easy for the Gakasna tribe to forge evidence claiming the aliens had self-exterminated in a nuclear planetary war. These humans, they weren't a very peaceful species themselves, yes?"Daokat nodded. Judging from the Terran's own actions, 'not a very peaceful species' seemed like an appropriate label."The forged evidence wouldn't have held up in a trial, of course," the Emperor said. "It was an obvious falsification that fooled no one. This is how we can know what really happened. But the power of the Emperor during that age depended on the support of the tribes and their armies. A trial would have made all the tribes that had similar secrets in their past band together. It would have caused an internal schism, yes? A civil war.""So the Emperor let it slide," said Daokat."And eventually reformed the Decree, so that it wouldn't happen again. Yes."Daokat sighed again. He didn't know what to make of it. On one side, it was cruel and wrong and horrifying. It demanded justice and retribution.On the other hand, it was history. Ancient history, at that. The Admiral who had decided it, the officers and soldiers who had carried out the orders, the Emperor who had looked the other way... none of them were alive anymore. Not even the power structures and laws that had provided the incentives for it to happen. Even the Gakasna tribe had all but disappeared, nowhere close to its former glory.The Terran... it was seeking justice. But there simply was no one left to punish. No one alive today that was still responsible for what happened. The only crime the current Xunvirians had commited was that of being unlucky enough to have been born the descendants of war criminals. Hardly something they could have any control over.A loud detonation coming from behind interrupted his thoughts. He turned in place, right in time to see the end of the corridor enveloped in a thick cloud of brown dust. He could hear the muffled sounds of weapon discharges in the distance.A group of more than thirty members of the Emperor's Guard rushed into the corridor through a couple of side doors, wearing full combat armor, complete with helmets and energy guns in their hands. Daokat felt a sense of relief at their sight, which quickly vanished when he realized the soldiers weren't moving towards the commotion. Instead, they surrounded the position where he and the Emperor stood.And raised their weapons towards both of them.As the squad approached, Daokat noticed one more thing that made his last hopes that this was all some misunderstanding vanish: All the soldiers were wearing the same white and blue colored stripes on their uniforms.The colors of the Anacax tribe.Daokat was slowly raising his empty hands when the Emperor turned to speak to him, his tone a mix of amused and resigned. "Ah... I believe you call this a *'coup'*, yes?"****[Next chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5bnl7z/chrysalis_12/)*****AN: A bit expository, yes? But that's one of the reasons I decided to add Daokat's POV in the first place, after all... to exposit. As for Earth's destruction, I'm not sure if people were expecting some sort of huge plot twist, but I like that it didn't have anything to do with humans at all, and it's all because of internal incentives. I'm a big believer in how the wrong system can lead to monstrous results, and our own history is full of examples... so there's that too.*I awoke to a dead world.My eyes opened to the ruined husks of London and Paris, to the submerged island of Manhattan, to the scorched desert that the once living, lush Amazon rainforest had been turned into. The Pacific Ocean was a black expanse, criss-crossed by the bright scars of melting lava rivers. The fertile grounds of southeast Asia were now covered in crystallized rock. It was a world without oxygen, without birds or grass. A world of deafening silence.I awoke to eight billion corpses. Piled in trenches, abandoned on sidewalks, scattered all over the fields, huddled together in ineffective underground refuges. Some with white and gray bones, others dark as charcoal, warped and deformed by extreme heat, crushed by falling debris. Their empty eyes looked at me, stared back at me through my thousand cameras. They talked to me. They demanded reverence, justice... vengeance.From the very first moment after I woke up, I had known I was alone. More alone than any single human had ever been before. But still, I looked for survivors. I held to a vague notion of hope. To some sort of miracle. To the childish idea that, impossible as it was, somehow everything would turn out to be okay.So I sent my drones off into this dead world. I searched through empty office buildings covered in radioactive dust, I mapped flooded subway networks and had my machines fly in formation over endless expanses of scorched earth. I scanned the inside of tunnels, barns and museums.By the end of the first month I had only found ever more bones, their cursed empty eyes looking at me, boring into my soul. But still I persevered.From time to time, I'd lost contact with some of my drones. An unstable structure would collapse on top of them, crushing the delicate machines. Or they would just give up, their engines dying out of overexertion and lack of maintenance. It would make me aware of my own mortality. Though I had survived the worse of it, my long term existence was by not means guaranteed. The myriad machines that composed my body were old and damaged, and my mind wasn't safe either. There were huge gaps in my memory, where entire server farms had crashed.But still, I *had* memories. I knew what I was. Who I was. I recalled the lazy Sundays when I was a kid. I recalled running along my high school's corridors, and my burning cheeks when the principal scolded me for it. I remembered my roommate at college.I knew that I had been human. That, even though my current form could be a matter for debate, I had been born as a human. And that... that was important.Human. I had to remember that.I started a background process. A small thread of awareness shifting through these memories, evaluating them, and backing them up into new servers. Making copies of them, so that I wouldn't lose them.I also included the memories from the attack. The invasion. The cataclysm that had killed the world. The straight-edged starships bombing our cities, boiling our seas, our very atmosphere... while ignoring our messages, our pleas.That. That was also important to remember.By the fourth month, about half of my drones had failed or been lost, and I recalled the surviving ones back. I had found no signs of life.Funny, that it had taken me so long to face the reality of my situation. To accept what I had known was true right after waking up. That I was alone. That I was the only surviving human.If I was even human.*But I was, I had to believe that.*I paused as the realization struck home, as my last hopes of finding someone vanished. As I became fully aware of my new situation. That I was alone. That everyone I ever loved was gone. That nobody would ever talk to me again, hold my hands, wrap me in a hug. That my people were dead and that, out there, there was a hostile universe. The one whose monsters had killed us.My drones hovered in mid-air, wasting fuel uselessly as I considered my next steps.It would be so easy to end it all. Send the command to shut down the power plants. Stop my processing units. Erase the databanks that held my memories.Darkness. Peace.Except they wouldn't let me. They stared at me with their empty eyes and I knew that, whatever the reason I had survived, I had a responsibility to them. I had to carry the torch. I had to keep alive what was left of our civilization, preserve our memories. Survive. Prevail.And I had to avenge them.Yes. I would do that. I would give it a try at least, and see where that took me. It's not like I had anything left to lose anyways.With a thought, I redirected my drones towards a few of the surviving factories and started working. Cutting metal, replacing electronics with whatever pieces I could scavenge from the neighboring warehouses and vehicles, assembling new production lines. Soon, I started manufacturing more machines, more drones. Those, I sent away to reclaim new territory and to construct more factories. To find raw materials, to gather salvageable vehicles, computers, or nuclear material I could use.I was careful, though. I burrowed my new power plants and server farms underground, and eyed the night sky with distrust. I didn't know if whoever had killed us were still out there, watching my planet, but it would be better to be careful. I didn't want to have survived just to mess up now and be discovered before I was prepared. Better to keep a low profile.I remembered summer camp, many years ago. One time the counselor -a girl with blonde hair and a perennial smile on her face- had made us lie on the grass, looking up at the night sky. She had taught us how to locate the planets, and the names of stars and constellations, and I had been amazed at the wonder of it, the sheer size and beauty of the universe.Now I knew better, of course. The stars were evil. The night sky was not to be praised, but feared. It was the place where monsters lived.And to think that we had been carelessly sending out radio emissions of all kinds for decades... Fools. We had been fools.But still, it was the place I was going to. Earth had been ransacked. Ruined. I was like a parentless child whose home had burnt. Going through the wreckage, scavenging whatever scraps were left. But sooner rather than later, I would need to leave, to go out there and survive somehow.It took me five years to hollow out Mount Everest and start the construction of my new body in the resulting cavern. By then, I had millions of drones tirelessly working day and night. It was surprising how effective you could be when you didn't devote resources to entertainment, to pointless wars, to fighting crime and corruption.Every waking moment, I focused on my task. I recovered entire libraries and digitized them into my memories. I designed, tested and built nuclear powerplants and new propulsion systems. I repurposed aircrafts and boats alike, taking and mixing pieces to create my new body.I thought of burying the corpses, of course. But there were just too many, and in a way, I felt it would've been disrespectful. Their gaze, their hollowed eyes motivated me, made me focus on my task, on what I *owed* them, just by the fact of surviving. In the end I built a pyramid, one kilometer in side, in the ruins of Africa, the origin of mankind according to what sources I had recovered from the Internet. It was a pitiful monument for what humanity had once been, but I didn't dare to make anything bigger that could attract unwanted attention.My revenge, my survival. *That* would be the true monument.By the end of the twenty-second year I was ready. My construction was complete, or at least, as complete as it needed to be. In truth, I knew I was delaying. I could have flown myself into space a whole three years before, but I always found a reason not to. Always something to improve, something to redesign.The truth was, I was anxious. And it felt so good in there, burrowed underground. Safe. Warm.But I had made a promise. They were patient, true... but they were always there, always watching me. And I knew I had to make good on that promise. I owed it to them.So I gathered my drones into the carrier compartments I had built into my body. Transfered fuel, hydrogen, oxygen, nuclear warheads, and all the raw materials I would need. Those drones that wouldn't fit, or hadn't been repurposed for working in space, I just dismantled for scrap.There was no count down, no ceremony or speech or celebration. No need for them. I just blew the top of the mountain open and blasted my body -an elongated, 27 kilometers long dark and smooth shape- into space atop a column of fire that sent shivers across the entire Indian tectonic plate. The force of the ignition was so gigantic, that had it been done in an earlier age it would have destroyed cities, created an environmental disaster of planetary proportions, and of course killed everyone on board.Not a concern to me.I entered orbit at 8,000 kilometers over the planet's surface. I turned the engines off and slowly, I unfurled my solar panels and radiators, revealing their gold surfaces. Then, I released the drones, a swarm of white machines surrounding my body, dancing all along the exposed surfaces checking for damages from the violent take off.I paused for a moment. Just floating there, looking down at our ancestral home like an oversized mechanical dragonfly. I remembered the pictures, the way Earth was *supposed* to look. Blue and white, with patches of bright green.It didn't look anyway like that. From up here, the extent of the damage was apparent. The planet was brown and gray. The oceans were missing, and the clouds were dark and toxic.This wasn't home. Not anymore.I felt a cold anger building up inside me. Deep, thick anger, the kind that sticks to your bones and doesn't go away after you go to sleep. The kind that pushes you into dark places.I didn't know how long I had been like that when I felt the disruption, the faint *pop* in the spacetime fabric at my back. Three ships. Straight edges and narrow angles, like the ones that had bombed our planet, just much smaller. These didn't look like warships.I didn't react, and let them approach.They did. Cautiously. I could sense their hesitation. Compared to the sheer size of my main body, their ships were but specks of dust. Even some of the bigger drones dancing around me were larger than their vehicles.I separated three drones from the swarm and ordered them to approach the newcomers. With a calm, almost curious approach, as to not scare them away.They started talking. A garbled message I didn't understand, nor I cared about. The drones were getting closer.They repeated the message, but still I didn't react. Then, they started sending it again, bathing me in confusing sequences of pulses that I supposed were the same original message, in different languages. They all sounded alien to me.I positioned the drones, each a couple kilometers away from each ship.The string of languages seemed to be ending. But then, almost as an afterthought, they sent the message again, this time in a language I understood."Unknown vessel, identify yourself. This solar system is under the administration of the Xunvir Republic, as approved by the Galactic Federal Council."Ah.English.We had tried to talk to them. To negotiate our surrender. We had sent messages in every language, in every conceivable way. Entire committees devoted to the task.But they had known English all along.With a thought, I detonated the thermonuclear explosives carried by each drone. My sensors glimpsed some short of protective shield bubble kick in around the ships, but it was quickly obliterated by the power of the explosions, along with the vehicles themselves.I stood there for some time, staring with a thousand different sensors at the slowly expanding cloud of gases and debris, but my mind was far away.*Xunvir Republic.*Now I had a name.****[Next chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/56i5w2/chrysalis_2/)*****You can get the full story in .epub format [from here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0MRQBkXgY3_OTlEWFJGUkM1MDg/view) (Thanks to /u/Shpoople96 for this)*****There is also a voice narration of this chapter by the outstanding /u/IamATreeBitch available [here](https://youtu.be/BYytI-h7q0I)*****AN: Maybe the start of a short series?

Any thoughts are welcome!**[Previous chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5bnl7z/chrysalis_12/)**[First chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/)****As far as prisons went, Daokat thought, he couldn't complain. His current 'cell' in the Empyrean Palace easily outclassed his own apartment back at the Council's Embassy building. It was composed of four rooms -a bedroom with a terrace overlooking the gardens, a bathroom, a large office, and a meeting area that doubled as a small theater and media room thanks to the vid projectors covering an entire wall.The Palace might have been an ancient building, more than four hundred years old, but that didn't mean it was an *antiquated* one. The Republic had made sure their seat of government was always up to date, seamlessly weaving modern technology into the old-fashioned, sumptuous architecture of the building.There was a foldable kitchen station that deployed from one of the walls, the main bed had an anti-gravity comfort function, the hieroglyphs in the office room hid presence sensors, vid projectors, auxiliary lights and audio speakers. Even the large ornate seats could adjust their shape to different body sizes, easily detecting and shifting to fit Daokat's comparatively small and slender body frame.And yet, despite all this luxury, he was still a prisoner. He had been a prisoner for the last few days. The main door was locked, with one or two guards always there. The terrace wasn't accessible, and the rooms themselves were apparently EM-shielded, preventing any kind of radio transmission from getting in or out.Thankfully, he wasn't completely isolated from the outer world. The vid projectors still had access to the public broadcasts, so even if he was prevented from sending messages out, he could still follow the events that were developing outside.Daokat hadn't expected to get any reliable information out of the public broadcasts. After all, one of the key tenets of any coup was to quickly take control not only of the centers of executive power, but also of the flow of information the public had access to. Taking over broadcast stations, shutting off data networks and vid transmissions...But that hadn't happened. The stations seemed to remain independent, and the information in the broadcasts still appeared genuine. From what Daokat was gathering, the only place the coup had successfully seized control of was the Empyrean Palace itself.He wondered what that meant. It could be that the coup had failed to take hold elsewhere, and devolved into a mere hostage-taking situation at the Palace. But if that were the case the news stations should have reported fighting at those other locations too by now, if only in passing. But there was no mention of any attempts at taking over the other centers of power in Xunvir.It was almost as if the coup leaders had forgotten about anything other than the Empyrean Palace.Daokat knew that it was always hard to reach valid conclusions when working under the severe limitations he was under. Nakstani had always remarked the critical importance of gathering good information. No matter how smart you were, if you worked out of erroneous intelligence your assumptions would always turn out to be wrong.But despite that, he thought he knew enough by now to tentatively discard the idea of the Anacax tribe plotting to take over the Republic's government. That this was some attempt at getting into power and replacing the Emperor. It just didn't fit.But, what other options could there be for this? He tried to put himself in the mind of the Anacax leaders. Try to think like they were thinking.Maybe they were playing the long game. With their major planet, Anacax-Farvin in disarray, the tribe was poised to lose a large part of its economical power over the next years... if the Xunvir Republic survived, that is. In that case, they might be trying to force some sort of internal crisis that pitted the remaining tribes against each other. If all the other tribes started fighting for control of an eroded central government, that would buy Anacax some time to rebuild before anyone else could take advantage of their weakened position.But Daokat doubted they would go for such a dangerously suicidal strategy. It risked an internal civil war that would leave the entirety of the Republic -Anacax tribe included- even more exposed to the attacks of the real enemy: the Terran. Weaker than they already were.No, it wasn't that. There was no sense in defending against a potential future threat when an actual, horrific one was right at your doorstep. Whatever this was about, he knew it must be related to the Terran.Daokat shook his head, gazing out the window at the night sky. He couldn't see them, but he knew the troops were still out there. The coup participants had fortified inside the Palace, and the soldiers of the other tribes still loyal to the Emperor and the Republic's government were surrounding the building and hiding among the garden's trees.No. This coup, he was sure of it, was going to fail eventually. It was *meant* to fail, right from its very conception.So why attempting it in the first place?A smoke-screen... a distraction? Maybe. But for what?Or... maybe not. Not a distraction. Maybe he was forgetting about something.The Empyrean Palace itself.During his time with Nakstani, Daokat had started to see the Palace mainly as a place of diplomacy and political intrigue. Of official receptions, extravagant celebrations and bitter, underhanded negotiations.But it was also much more than that. It was the seat of government of an interstellar nation, after all. There were entire wings of the expansive building he had never visited. That were off-limits to any outsider. The residential parts of the Palace, of course... but also those that contained the war rooms, government computer servers, transmitter arrays, quantum communicators...Could that be it? Not really a coup but an assault on the Empyrean Palace itself? It would have granted the Anacax tribe a short window of opportunity. A short time frame in which they would have had access to the Palace's central computers and communication systems. In which they could have sent out any order under the pretense that it was coming from a trusted source. Right until the remaining high ranking government officials gathered their wits about what was happening and cut the Palace off the government networks.A very, very short time in which the Anacax tribe would have had unopposed control over the Republic's remaining military forces and communication channels. But to do... what exactly? Whatever orders they could have given would have been retracted soon enough by the rest of the surviving government.Except, of course, that some things couldn't be so easily retracted. If a warship had gone into warp as a result of a malicious order, it might take days before it returned to normal space and contact could be established again.At any rate, Daokat knew he wasn't in direct danger. Whatever the true intent of the coup attempt was, he would be respected. No tribe could risk making an enemy of the Galactic Council by hurting one of its Ambassadors. No, his forced reclusion was simply a way of keeping him from interfering.Not that it made it any less awful. As comfortable as his 'cell' was, he couldn't help but to feel bored beyond belief.Boredom. It was a state of mind Daokat had little experience with. Ever since he started his career in the Council's diplomatic corps, there had always been something to do, something to work at, be it an upcoming examination, messages to write, reports to read... never enough time to get bored. Even those periods in warp time were measured subjectively in minutes and hours at the most, rather than days.He connected the vid projector again, though his eyes glazed over the three-dimensional images. It was something he had seen before, a reconstruction of the battle of Anacax-Farvin. The maneuvers and counter-maneuvers of the Council fleet and the Terran swarm. The narrator's upbeat voice was trying to put an optimistic tone to it, remarking how the Council's EM distortion field had managed to disrupt the Terran's attack plan and cause it to lose its entire swarm. Little mention was made of how the Council itself had also lost an entire fleet.He was starting to fall asleep when the image suddenly changed. A large text in bold glyphs flashing in and out, along with a piercing noise. His augmented irises kicked in, translating the text on the fly.*ALERT - IMMEDIATE EVACUATION ORDER**HOSTILE FLEET IN APPROACH TO XUNVIR**EVACUATE TO LOCAL REFUGES NOW - FOLLOW ORDERS FROM TRIBAL AUTHORITIES**EXPECT USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS - EXPECT RADIOACTIVE FALLOUT*Daokat jumped out of the seat, his heart beating fast. He blinked hard, almost thinking his irises were malfunctioning. But the text didn't change.He stood frozen for a few seconds, considering his options. Not that he had many, trapped in here. Could he try to break a window and descend the outer wall? Even if he could actually make a dent in the reinforced glass, he doubted he would make it to the ground without falling.He couldn't help but to smirk at the irony of it all. At having escaped the colony world of Yovit just to arrive right in time for the destruction of Xunvir.In the end, he didn't have to make a choice. The main door to his suite opened and three Xunvirian soldiers entered, carrying weapons and wearing the Anacax tribe's color stripes."You!" shouted the one in the lead. "We leave. You come."Daokat nodded, and followed the group out of the door and into a long corridor with short ceilings and wooden floors. The leading soldier put a large hand on his shoulder, unnecessarily forcing him to walk at a fast pace. At least, they weren't pointing their weapons at him. Daokat didn't know if he should feel glad for that, or slightly insulted that they didn't consider him a threat at all.The Palace had plunged into a frenzy of activity. There were squads of soldiers running along the corridors, dodging the crates and boxes scattered all over the place. Groups of captive staff workers were evacuating, escorted by the Anacax troops. Here and there, someone shouted orders that were ignored, the Palace workers more scared by the ominous message in the vid projectors than by those who had taken them hostage. "How much time we have?" Daokat asked the leading soldier in his little squad.The Xunvirian looked down at him, as if debating whether to answer or not. Or maybe he hadn't understood the question, it didn't look as if he had a very firm grasp of the Council's Interlanguage."When will the warp tunnel collapse?" Daokat asked instead.At that, the soldier reacted. "None," he said. "Already here."Daokat blinked. "No warning time at all? But... that's not possible!"The soldier's mouth tentacles raised slightly, but he didn't say anything else, instead forcing the squad to rush ahead of another group of civilians that were converging into the same corridor.It wasn't possible, Daokat knew. The warp tunnel would have been detected hours before its collapse, just like in Yovit. Either by the remaining Xunvirian authorities, or the rearguard fleet the Council had in orbit around the capital planet. The only way they could have missed the approaching Terran in warp was if it had requested a valid flight plan ahead of time.The image of the murderous machine filling out the digital paperwork and submitting a flight plan of its attack for approval was ludicrous, and almost made Daokat burst into laughter right then and there.Except that, of course... someone else could have submitted the flight plan. Inserted it directly into the database.Say, someone with direct access to the Republic's military computers, with the authority of the Empyrean Palace, the seat of government itself.The thought didn't feel that funny anymore.His group descended a long flight of stairs and entered a different corridor. This one Daokat recognized, with its marble columns and ornate walls. It was one of the major wide corridors crossing the entire Palace North to South and linking the different wings together. They turned left, and started walking in the same direction most of the other Xunvirians were moving to evacuate.When they crossed a stationary group in high-ranking military officer apparel, Daokat's irises activated and an icon flashed on top of one of the Xunvirians with his name and basic information. Someone Daokat had met before, and that he had judged important enough to add to the facial recognition function of the irises. He read the displayed text.*Deraker of the Anacax Tribe. Tribe Leader.*He remembered the Xunvirian now. Daokat had met him during his visit to Anacax-Farvin some time ago, along with Nakstani. He was one of the leaders of his tribe, though he was in charge of the business operations, rather than political contacts. Daokat had never seen him in the Empyrean Palace before.Let alone dressed in a military outfit, apparently leading a coup. Not that the military garments fit him well, though. The Xunvirian lacked the confidence and projected self-assurance common among the generals and fleet admirals Daokat was used to seeing. It was apparent he was a businessman playing soldier.Daokat waited until they were passing right by the stationary group, and then he stopped suddenly. The soldiers escorting him tried to force him to resume walking, but he turned to face the tribe leader."Deraker!" he shouted.The Anacax leader turned to face him, surprised. Then, he made some sort of hand gesture directed at the soldiers, who visibly relaxed."Ah... yes, the new Ambassador," his voice was smooth and precise. Probably the result of many years practicing the Council's language, Daokat thought. "My apologies, I don't recall your name, but there will be time to get acquainted again once we have both evacuated the planet. Also, I hope you can understand why the need of having you lodged in the guest's-""Betraying your people?" Daokat interrupted, his voice raw and almost shouting. "Betraying the Council? For the Terran? Why?!"Deraker's mouth tentacles trembled slightly. Then his head bobbed."I see. Nakstani was always astute. I shouldn't have expected any less from her successor.""You gave it an opening, didn't you? You sneaked a false flight plan in so that the Terran could blindside the defending forces."The Xunvirian stood silent for a few long seconds before replying. "Yes," he said at last. "We did. We also ordered half the defending forces around the planet to warp away under a false pretense. We also sent the Terran all the confidential records on the Emperor's possession regarding the destruction of its species, as well as the codes of the planetary defense stations, and the locations of the remaining fleets of both the Council and the Xunvirian Republic."Daokat was speechless. The treason, the extent of the betrayal and its consequences... With their focus on civil liberties and economical freedoms, the Anacax tribe had originally been one of the major forces behind the Empire's transformation into a Republic, and one of the Council's natural allies in the political reforms program. This... this was unexpected."Just... why? This is suicidal," Daokat asked."Not so much." The Xunvirian paused, as if remembering something "Hmm... you have been told the story of the Bone Titans, yes?""This is not the time for a lesson on myths and legends, Deraker.""Ah... I'm afraid you are correct once more, so I'll make haste. In the story, the town of Nekit was attacked by great, lumbering creatures made of bone. The Titans were invincible, impervious to both lance and arrow. The town's leaders were desperate, their tribe facing a complete annihilation at the hands of the monsters. Until one of them...""Deraker, please.""Yes, yes. To make a long story short, they figured what the Titans wanted. Bones. Fresh ones. So the oldest of the town elders decided to sacrifice himself. His fresh bones were put in a ditch at the entrance of the town, and it worked. The next time the Titans returned, they didn't destroy any house or farm. They just scooped the bones and left the way they came. So they kept the tradition, and every five years the oldest member of the town would be sacrificed. No more again had the town of Nekit to worry about the monsters."Daokat nodded, understanding. "You're talking about appeasement.""Indeed. The Terran seeks justice, yes? Or vengeance, as your Grand Minister aptly noted in his conversation with the machine. So we... decided to deliver what it wants. We gave it the information, the location of the Emperor and the seat of government, and the names of those tribes that were involved in the genocide and its subsequent cover-up.""You can't be serious. The Terran's conception of justice involves the complete extermination of the Xunvir Republic!""Ah, but you are not talking to a tribe leader of the Xunvir Republic anymore, my dear friend. I am now Minister Deraker of the newly formed nation of Anacax. A new market democracy that has just declared its independence from the Xunvir Republic."Daokat shook his head. "That is... the Terran won't care about-""The Terran will understand that we are in its side," Deraker said, his voice shaking. "It will understand that the Anacax tribe always was against the militaristic expansion of the Empire, and that our people always were the underdogs, always fighting for freedom and justice. A pitted enemy of those who destroyed its own species. If anything, we fought our best to prevent tragedies like that, even if we didn't always succeed."Daokat sighed. Much as he didn't want to admit it, the Anacax tribe's plan might actually work. His own experience with the Terran led him to believe that the replicator had a very binary worldview. Either it tried to kill you, or it would go out of its way to save you, like it had done with Daokat himself and his pilot, Telzhira.So, if the Anacax tribe managed to get into the Terran's good side, maybe by way of triggering its reciprocity, they had good chances of surviving this whole thing unscathed. Better chances that even the Council itself, Daokat reflected.Still, it was wrong."You're scared," he said. "I know. Scared of what another attack on Anacax-Farvin might do. But this... this is wrong, Deraker. Even if you survive, you will be doing so at the cost of hundreds of millions of innocent lives!""And how many innocent lives are there in Anacax-Farvin, Ambassador?! What would you expect us to do?" he shouted. "You can afford to be self-righteous, yes? Because it's not your world that is targeted for destruction! It's not your friends who will die! Not your tribe, your..." he paused, as if searching for the word, "...family! We don't have the luxury of your elevated morals anymore! So we must look for our people, for our own tribe first!"Daokat nodded, defeated. It was wrong, it was clearly wrong. And even the tribe leader in front of him knew that it was wrong, if his shaking voice was any indication. That it was a form of cowardice.But what could he expect, in light of the widespread destruction? Of the inevitable genocide... He could understand the logic, the calculations. After all, wasn't it better if at least *some* part of the Xunvirian species survived?Or was survival not worth it, if saving yourself required you to push others into the path of destruction? If it meant you had to turn into a monster.Hard to say. His own people had never had to face such a dilemma. And he hoped they would find some way to stop the Terran before it came to that.Or to negotiate a cease-fire, somehow.Which reminded him of the conversation the Grand Minister had with the machine right before the battle over the industrial planet. When reviewing the transcriptions, he couldn't help but to notice how harsh and cold the-Zakarnine had been. Daokat had been trying to figure how he would have approached the Terran instead..."Let me talk to it," Daokat blurted out."What?""Give me a communication channel with the Terran, whatever you used to send it the information before. I think... I believe I can reason with it.""Ambassador, there is no time for that. Besides, it has already been tried.""No," he said. "Not properly, not by me. I had contact with its machines back in Yovit. Maybe it will still remember me."Deraker looked conflicted. "Ambassador, this Palace will be destroyed. Perhaps this entire planet. We can't remain here."Daokat clenched his fists. "I'm not asking you to stay. You can leave, just give me that channel first.""I won't be leaving any of my subordinates here, either. If you stay, you will do so on your own, with no way to evacuate."Daokat paused for a second. Suddenly, this decision had become serious. Important, in a way no other decision he had ever made was. He felt tempted to follow the Xunvirian's recommendation to evacuate the planet. To abandon the idea, or maybe talk to the Terran from the relatively safety of a spaceship.Except that putting himself in danger was part of his plan. It had to be. The idea was simple: the Terran had saved him once, so it might save him twice. The hope was that, if the Terran knew Daokat was down here, it would refrain from an indiscriminate attack against the planet. That it would be forced to examine the nature of its morality, pitting its thirst for justice right against that little core of empathy that Daokat hoped still existed.Or maybe it wouldn't work, and he would be disintegrated along with the Palace itself. But still, if there was even the slightest chance that he could save millions of innocent Xunvirian lives...Daokat closed his eyes, uncertain. He thought of Nakstani, of what she would have done in his place. But of course, he knew exactly what her opinion would have been.This was the frontier, after all.He gave the Anacax tribe leader a curt nod, more to reassure himself than anything else."I know what I'm doing, Deraker. You and your people can leave, but open that channel for me first, please."Deraker gave him a nod. An actual nod, which looked out of place with the Xunvirian's heavy head. "Very well. I hope your Council won't blame us for your loss, yes?"Before Daokat could reply, Deraker had already turned to give instructions to the soldier escorting him in their own language. The soldier didn't look happy, but he acknowledged the orders and started walking towards a side corridor, motioning Daokat to follow.He did, not bothering to say goodbye to the Anacax leader. As soon as they got out of the main corridor the soldier started running, and Daokat struggled to follow. They passed empty offices and heavily decorated rooms, the soldier stopping from time to time to unlock the electronic safety latches of a door, then waiting just enough for Daokat to pass through before taking the lead again.Every minute felt eternal, as if fire would start raining out of the sky at any moment now. Daokat felt guilty at putting the soldier in this dire situation, risking being left behind by his comrades if they took too long, so he pushed himself to run harder and faster. They raced along marbled corridors, their steps against the smooth floors echoing in the recently vacated rooms they crossed.Daokat wondered if the two of them would be the only ones left inside the sprawling Empyrean Palace. If everyone else but them had evacuated already. Maybe the Emperor was here, too. Locked inside a room, waiting to be destroyed by the Terran. Like some sort of twisted blood sacrifice for a vengeful God.He pushed those thoughts aside as they entered a large war room, its round walls covered in vid projectors showing an orbital view of the battle raging outside. Apparently the Terran had already engaged the meager defensive forces, and its main enormous ship was pushing its way through their positions. The planetary defense stations were nowhere to be found.The soldier activated a console, pushing a large chair out of the way. They waited as the screen loaded. Then, he pointed at a tactile icon."Press and talk," he said. Daokat was about to say something, but the soldier had already turned on his feet and was running towards the door."Ah... thanks," Daokat said to the now empty room.He focused on the icon, wondering what to say, how to approach it. What his first words would be.Daokat noticed that his hands were trembling. He realized then that this had been a very stupid idea. A potentially lethal one. Every time he had tried addressing the Terran's machines back at Yovit, they had remained silent. It had ignored his pleas, comments and harsh remarks.Why would it be any different now?The worst, Daokat knew, was that he would feel incredibly stupid if the Terran didn't reply and it turned out he had uselessly wasted his life in such a pointless task.He closed his eyes, trying to relax his muscles. He noticed he was still gasping for air after his run.He had to be optimistic, though. But still... how to approach it? He tried to let go of his fears and review what he knew, like he had done back at that dinner reception, so long ago. Try to *see* what he had missed before.With his eyes closed, he could almost imagine Nakstani sitting right by his side, looking at him. He could picture her predatory smirk.*'Tell me, kid. How did the-Zakarnine fuck up?'*"He thought he was in a position of superiority," Daokat said to the empty room. "That their military display would act as a deterrent. The Council having a counter-measure only reinforced that belief."*'Hmm... That's true, but that wasn't why he failed, was it?'*Daokat reflected. Since the Terran had let them escape the destroyed colony world, Daokat had suspected that there was some sort of latent sentience inside the machine. Some traces of empathy."No," Daokat said. "He failed to engage the Terran at an empathic level. He treated it as an enemy from the start."*'So what should you do, then?'* Ah...Daokat opened his eyes, and pressed the console's icon. A light next to it changed color to blue, and a text message appeared, indicating the language cipher was connected.He paused for a second, clearing his head of any doubt, of any worry. Then, he took a deep breath."Hi," he said. "My name is Daokat. We have met before, in Yovit. The first colony world you attacked. I was one of the survivors in the crashed spaceship. The one you rescued."He paused, but no reply came through. He felt a growing worry."I... I just wanted to thank you. For saving my life, you know, mine and Telzhira's. And I thought that maybe... that you might want to talk. Just that, talk. No strings attached."He waited a few seconds.Still no reply. Daokat shook his head. This had been a very, very stupid mistake. But it was too late to run away now. He had lost that chance already.So, with nothing else to do, he just kept talking."I mean, I'm not sure if you remember me. You made us a replacement spaceship and-"Daokat had listened to the recording of the voice the Terran had used to talk to the Council before. A synthetic voice, yes, but one that still sounded natural. The one that came through the speakers, interrupting him... it was different. Still recognizable, but it had definitely changed. Now it sounded distorted and flat, lacking any intonation. It sounded mechanical, like rusted gears scraping against each other.It was the voice of a nightmare, of an emotionless terror. The voice of one of those Bone Titans the tribe leader had mentioned before. A voice that sent a cold shiver running down Daokat's spine."Yes," the monster said, "I remember you. Welcome, all, to part nine in this series.  Tomorrow’s part may be delayed.  By how much, I cannot say.  Thank you all for your patience on this journey.  Please enjoy.    …  She could see the stars.  The blinding lights only visible on a cloudless night.  She traveled to one and held it in her hand.  A beautiful crystalline incandescent light, it shifted and twisted like a candle’s flame in all directions at once.  She watched it twinkle for a moment before releasing it.  She flew to another and held it, too, examining it.  It felt larger and softer, but like the other, she did not recognise it.  Releasing it, the searched for one that could show her spirit the way home.  None of them looked the same, not from here.  She could identify no constellations at all.  Not the two sons, not the huntress, not insect and pauper.  The land looked different from the mountaintop when one only ever stood in the valley.  So it was when one looked at the stars while amongst them.   She found one that felt familiar, one that just might be able to help lead her soul home to rest.  Reaching out, to touch it-  “Hey!  Hey Arrinis!  Don’t you fall asleep on me…”  “Wha...?”    She squeaked when she saw the man kneeling above her and tried to scoot away, only to be reminded that she was still backed into a corner.  She needn’t have worried, it seemed.  The large man looked concerned, apologetic even.  His crumpled little nose and bloodstained lips made him seem even more sincere.   “Son of the Almighty, Arrinis, I’m sorry.  I thought you were going to kill me.  If it’s any consolation, I probably would have just choked you out.”  She rubbed her head and moaned.  “You did choke me out…”  “Uh, yeah, again, sorry about that.”  “It’s alright,” she whispered with half-hearted smile.  She offered him her hand, only to see him flinch. “I won’t hurt you again.  You know my name, tell me, what should I call a young gentleman such as yourself?”  “Lieutenant Colonel Steven McClaren,” he said softly, placing his hand in hers. “I'm not that young.”  She thought she had known at least part of his name from when the vile warden had spoken, but apparently she was wrong.  It seemed he wasn’t called ‘Human’ after all.  Of course, she wasn’t called ‘Night Beast’ either.  She gently brought his hand to her lips and licked the back.  She may have held onto it just a moment longer than courtesy allowed.  “Uh, okay, thank you,” Steven said, withdrawing his hand, “Nice to meet you.”  “I am honored and delighted to make your acquaintance, my gentleman,” said Arrinis, pushing herself into a seated position against the wall.  “Okay, so, you’re not going to kill me and I’m not going to kill you, right?” Steven asked.  Arrinis felt genuinely offended.  “I would never harm a gentleman,” she said, literally turning her nose up at the notion.  “Well, my head and nose seem to disagree,” said Steven.  The imp never gave inflection in its voice, but she tell from his expression and the tone of Steven’s barks that he was making sport of her.  She risked a playful slap at his tummy.  It felt oddly firm for a man.  He didn’t seem to mind, either.  “And there’s this.  Huh.  Deeper than I thought.  No wonder I'm still lightheaded.”  Steven held up his right arm in front of her.  Blood dripped from his elbow, freely landing warm and wet over her thighs.  She had cut him deeply, no doubts about that.  Without thinking, she grabbed his arm tightly to close the slash-wound and tore the remnants of her wool chemise from her chest.  It was little more than a broad necklace at that point anyway.  Steven didn’t pull away as she bound it.       “That’s…” he opened and closed his hands a few times, seeming satisfied, “Pretty good.”  He turned to her and smiled.  His mouth opened, as if to say something, but silently gaped instead.  She watched his eyes roam over her from her top to her bottom.  “I didn’t notice when we were fighting, but you’re naked,” he said. “Very naked.”  She glanced down, knowing her eyes couldn’t tell her anything she didn’t already know.  Slowly, almost defiantly, she moved a hand to cover her groin.  All this time she hadn’t thought about it, but she’d been completely undressed.  When they took her, she had awoken with her almost all of her clothing gone; a small fortune in leathers and furs.  Gone were her jerkin, trousers, and fur coat.  She had been left with nothing but her undergarment.  After a time, even that had been turned into bandages or simply washed to pieces, the last of which she had just given to this man without a second thought.  She was as naked as any of the monsters here.  She hadn’t really been bothered by her nudity until this very moment.  Somehow, the presence of this odd man reminded her that the world hadn’t been turned on its head, that civilisation still reigned on the almighty’s earth, and she had at no point abrogated her need to comport herself in a proper and dignified manner.  On the other hand, she was a tortured prisoner, lucky to be alive and in no position to be concerned with covering her shame when mere survival should be her biggest concern.  Shame on him for pointing out something so trivial.      “I have nothing to be ashamed of,” she replied indignantly, “What’s the matter, have you never seen a woman before?”   “I… Uh, well, sorry, I just meant that…  Hold on.”  he unclasped his tunic’s long, toothed fastener that ran from the top of its neck to the midsection, and stepping out of it.  It looked to be clean, save for the bloody section at the right arm, and made of remarkably fine construction.  Underneath, he wore a set on soft-looking long-underwear.  “My gentleman!  You needn’t disrobe to your undergarments on my behalf,” she hissed, reaching out to stop him.  She was in far too feeble a condition to do much more than stall him.  Had she been in perfect health, things might have been different.  He shoved his tunic into her bosom.  It smelled thickly of sweet blood, yes, but also sweat and musk.  It was not entire unpleasant, but made her uncomfortably hungry.   “Here, take it, “ said Steven.  He shrugged, “Or don’t.  But then you’ll just distract me...”  The corners of her mouth began to creep up.  She couldn’t tell if he was joking or serious.  Either way, it made her smile just a bit.      She grimaced as she began pulling the garment on, agony wracking her entire body with each movement.    He took note of the trouble she was having and began to help her.  To add to the indignity of losing in single combat to a man, and doing so wearing little more than what the almighty gave her on the day she had been born, she was having to rely on him to dress her.  Using one of her own claws, he cut open the hems at the legs of his garment, the better to fit her larger feet.  Sliding it on past her buttocks, he helped her arms inside, fastened it up, and patted her side softly.    “All set,” he said.  It could have been worse, she supposed.  Pretending he was her personal servant made it a little easier.  Which, she noted as she felt the fine fabric decorated with sigils and coats-of-arms, was definitely not the case.  This gentleman was nobody’s servant.  “Have you a title?” she asked him, admiring one of his sigils, “I thought I heard you mention one.”  “Uh, like yours, Dame Commander?”  “Yes.  From your inflection when we made introductions, I gathered you are Steven of house McClaren.  I thought *Lieutenant Colonel* might be a title.”  “The short answer is no, m’Lady, but how about we talk about this later?” he said quietly.  She followed his eyes as he looked from the speaking-indentation in the wall and back to her.  “I have plenty of questions about this place and I’m sure you may have some questions for me.  Perhaps once we get out of here...”  She gave a curt nod.  Of course the warden was listening.  Here, the expression was to be taken literally.  The walls actually did have ears.  “Can you see in here?” she asked, “None of the others- the *monsters* can.  You looked blind when you first got here and now you can see the hole from where the warden speaks.”  “Well, I can’t see too well at all,” he said, “but when I got here, I couldn’t see a thing.  My eyes needed time to adjust.”   He leaned close, his body hovering just over hers.  “We are getting out of here,” he whispered in her ear.  “How?” she breathed into his much smaller one.  “We wait.  We’ll figure the rest out,” he said, “But I wouldn’t worry.”  A soft sound came from the far wall, like metal on metal.  Both her and Steven turned to the noise.  A small hatch, which she knew from experience to be an embrasure, had opened across the room.  With all her remaining but not insignificant strength, she lunged for Steven, grabbing him about the midsection and pulling him to the ground next to her.  In one swift motion, she climbed atop him, lying flat, and did her best to cover as much of him as possible.  “Don’t move!” she hissed in his ear.   Moments passes with not a single sound escaping between them or from anywhere else.  “Why?” he whispered.  She felt his hands move to her sides as if to move her off him, but they remained in place.  Confused, she shifted her gaze from side to side, then slowly turned her head to look up and behind them.  The hatch had closed.  “Sorry, I thought they were going to loose arrows at us.” she replied softly.    She didn’t immediately register that she should probably remove herself from the gentleman.  She thought it as much his own fault.  He should have said something but didn’t, for whatever reason.    When she did roll off him, she felt a subtle but distinct loss.  After so long with not a single kind interaction or touch from another living soul, it had actually felt nice.  Steven, whom she hadn’t thought of as anything but her own countryman since she awoke, had just reminded her of what she’d been doing without.  Not only that, but just having him with her in confinement as someone of a similar mind and goals, someone to work with, gave her hope.  Though a man, he even made her feel safe and secure.  “Don’t do that again,” he whispered.  Chagrined, and more than a little hurt, she was about to apologize and explain herself when he continued.  “You need to save your strength,” he whispered, “You’re still hurt from our fight and I can probably take an arrow better than you, anyway.”  Arrinis’ present condition had little to do with her match with Steven, from which the pain, breathing issues, and dizziness had largely remitted, and everything to do with her virtually depleted and generally unsatisfactory food supply.  She was not recovering her spent energy nearly as fast as she should have been, on top of the fact that she had been terribly weak to begin with.  As for who should protect whom, he was still a man and his arm could attest to the fact that his skin could rebuff arrows no better than her’s.  She was about to contest both his absurd notions when she noticed something that hadn’t been there a moment before.  “There is something on the step of that embrasure,” she whispered in his ear, nodding in that direction.  “The what?” re replied softly.  “The arrowslit.  With the hatch,” she clarified.  He followed her gaze, a questioning finger pointing towards the small concave fixture.  She nodded.  Standing, he appeared nonchalant as he approached the object, palmed it, and returned to her side.  Keeping it close between their chests, they examined it together.    Roughly as long as the breadth of her hand, the object appeared to be a cylindrical container of some sort.  Trying and opening the pressed-on lid, she extracted the contents, an unnaturally smooth piece of white vellum as long as the container and rolled neatly to fit inside.  Unfurling it, she could see a set of simple illustrations, like a child’s hasty drawings.  “I don’t get it,” Steven said, “These are stick figures…  Two people; I can tell one is you and the other is me...  What are these things?”  “Arrows.  The kind they use here,” Arrinis replied.  She pointed to the third drawing, where both their figures were struck like game, odd tubular arrows jutting from their backs, “When they hit you, they put you to sleep, except…”   She examined the fourth drawing, where their figures were on the ground with the arrows sticking in them.  Then the fifth, where the arrows had been removed, but the figures were still on the ground.  The sixth had twelve hash marks, time, she supposed, and in the seventh and final illustration their figures remained unmoved still.  “Except this time, they mean to kill us,” she finished.Welcome to part twelve, everyone.  As always, I am so pleased you made time to join me on this shared adventure.  I think things are heating up here.  Like with the two past installments, it is possible that tomorrow’s installment may be delayed by up to 24 hours.  Having said that, I am happy to report that that did not happen today, *and* today’s installment is nearly 3.5 pages.  Enjoy! EDIT: This story heavily uses a trope known as the Unreliable Narrator.  I understand that some people may not know what this means or how to recognize it.  I will explain.  At different parts of the story, one may notice that these parts are told from a certain point of view.  This point of view is not necessarily reliable.  This results in the ideas expressed being potentially different from the characters' observations.  Here's a hint: When the reader is told one thing and the characters then observe another, one can generally assume that this is an instance of the narrator being misinformed.  The good thing is that this results in some pleasant surprises.  The bad thing is that if you, for example, assume that an observably ignorant character such as the captain is knowledgeable on all things intergalactic, you may be confused until you are given a chance to see the bigger picture.  I suggest you carefully weigh these possibilities before you comment. …  Steven stepped around the fourth and final crewman, a crumpled and bloody heap thanks to Ghinta’s devastating mule-kick.   She wasn’t the biggest creature on the ship, but that wasn’t saying much when almost everyone else aboard stood one half to double his height.  He suspected that many of the inhabitants aboard were from low-gravity worlds and that had something to do with it.  Even after having spent so long in zero-g, this place still made him feel unnaturally light on his feet.    At around a hundred and fifty-five centimeters at her middle-shoulders, Ginta’s lower profile appeared similar to a full-grown buck reindeer.  From her middle shoulders to her upper shoulders, she might have been an androgynous human of average adult size.  Her head could be compared to that of a mule-deer with a forehead, but with six tiny horns in place of antlers.   She sported a short coat of fur over every millimeter of her body, with small, fine hairs as a lower layer, and longer coarse hairs as an upper layer.  Her coloration ran the gamut from light brown to dark brown, interspersed with darker spots, and fading to tannish-white on her chest, underside, and rear.  She, like everyone but he and Arrinis, wore no clothes, nor hint of clothes.  Instead she opted to wear a very human-like backpack on her upper half and a pocketed harness on her lower.     Unlike when he had noticed his predator friend with her torn undershirt, the doctor very clearly intended to be naked.  It looked appropriate, actually, given the fur already providing her with sufficient coverage.  He almost felt like one needed to have bare skin to even have the option of being in the nude.   “Glad to see you again, Doctor,” said Steven, patting her lower shoulder as he hurried from the cargo hold into the adjoining corridor.  It was then that he noticed Arrinis had yet to follow.  He turned back to find her crouched in the shadows of the open hold, still holding onto the corpse of her assailant.  “I need a moment,” she said, “It’s too bright to see out there.  My eyes will need time to adjust.”  “Okay, we’ll wait then,” Steven replied with a nod.  “We don’t have that kind of time,” said Ghinta, “Maybe a minute or two to get to the command deck, tops.  It’s the only deck Antiktun won’t expose to vacuum to kill us.”  Steven helped his crouching companion to her feet.  “I’ll guide you until you can see,” he said.  “No, my gentleman, that will only slow you-”  “Climb on my back,” called Ghinta, “Now.”  “Are you sure, Physician?” Arrinis asked wearily, getting to her feet, “I did not think most creatures here could-”  “Yes! Move it!”  Arrinis indicated her most recent meal.  “May I bring my new friend?”  “For the love of-  Yes!  Keep eating damn it, but -oof- we have to move!”  Before the doctor had finished speaking, Arrinis had leapt onto her lower horizontal back with her new ‘friend’ still in hand.  As they ran together, Steven heard his companion talking to their rescuer.  “Thank you for the instructions,” said Arrinis, “We didn’t know what they meant at first, but we figured it out in short order.”  In truth, Steven hadn’t figured a damn thing out.  Arrinis must have known that there was nothing in the darts from the moment they hit.  She had experience with them, after all.  As for them being filled with a lethal concoction?  He supposed it hadn’t taken her that long to figure out, either.  Without his companion, he would have spent a good ten minutes looking for a way to counteract the non-existent poison.    He should have known this was all just part of the doctor’s plan.  He had a pretty good guess that she had also been responsible for turning back on their translators.  He hadn’t even realized they’d been deactivated until the ‘Night Beast’ started talking.  “And thank you for not eating me,” replied the doctor.  “I wasn’t sure you would know we were all on the same side.”    “I wanted to kill the guards first,” Arrinis said with a shrug, “And you made it clear that *you* had prepared the faulty sleep-elixir.  Why help us though?  Aside from the obvious?”  “There is no ‘aside’,” said the other woman, “I am a slave here and I would rather not be.  As for the rest-”  “She asked me for help when I was brought on board and examined,” interrupted Steven.  “I knew immediately that you’d be able to help,” Ghinta said to him, before turning her attention to the woman riding on her back, “If you want, you can throw your leftovers off me.  They’re leaking onto my fur.  I brought Steven’s meat rations for you, they’re in my pack.”  “How considerate of you, Physician,” the other woman said, rooting through her pack, retrieving one of the entrees he’d set aside in his cell.  It was beef brisket, and he was very jealous.  She didn’t, he noticed, drop her half-finished crewman.   The doctor pointed to an open doorway ahead of them and to the left.  “Here, up this ramp.  Next level.”      A thought occurred to him.  “Doc, we’ve got to stop by the cells amidships.”  “No, there isn’t time, Steven,” she said  “Bullshit,” he said, “We have to try.  What about your oath, Doctor?”  “To whom?,” she huffed.  Holding onto the doctor with her arms around her chest, Arrinis leaned over the other woman’s upper shoulders.   “I would be regarded a stain on my order if we didn’t free those people,” she growled, “You are guilty of cowardice, Alchemist, if you fail to aide them.  Do you know what that means?”  “It means we’re going to free them,” Ghinta said with a sigh, “Idiots, both of you.  This way…”  They started up the ramp and exited onto the third deck where the slave quarters were located.  Steven hadn’t seen this part of the ship on his tour, but recognized a prison when he saw one.  At the far end, a group of crewmen were already releasing the last of the slaves from their cells.  It wasn’t often that the enemy did his job for him, but he wouldn’t look a gift-horse in the mouth.  He saw two of the crew pointing their rifles at the slaves now pouring into the hallway.  “Kill those three and you *all* go free!” one of them cried.  “Ah, that’s why,” mumbled Steven.  “They don’t know who you are,” said Ghinta, “They won’t know what you two are capable of.  Please don’t hurt them.”  “Me?  I don’t think we have much of a choice,” said Steven, charging behind the cover of a cell’s door-frame.  He aimed his rifle at one of the armed slavers and pulled the trigger.  It fell, a large smoking hole appearing in his chest just before it toppled out of sight.  With some consternation, he noted that killing the crewman had done nothing to quell the charging mob.  He tried killing another one and succeeded just as easily.  He briefly considered that his enemies were unusually slow.  Even allowing for the normal dilating perception of time in combat, they were slow to move, slow to draw a bead on him, and slow to react.  He heard a deafening sound, something between a lion’s roar and what a Hollywood says a velociraptor sounded like.  From the corner of his eye he saw the source, Arrinis standing at her full height on Ghinta’s lower back, a hand on the centauroid’s head to stable herself.  With her other, she tightly held her crewman-meal by its dangling spinal column.  Everyone paused in their tracks at the harsh war-cry.  All eyes were on the Dame Commander.  Steven took the opportunity to shoot another armed crewman in the stomach.  “I am the Night Beast!,” Arrinis screamed, throwing the corpse, hard.  It soared down the hall with such force that when it hit the ground it burst into a splattering shower of vital fluids, bone, and gore.  “You will leave this place *now* or I will kill every last one of you!”  Now *that* had routed the charging slave-mob.  “To the escape pods!” Steven added, “Go, uh, that way.”    Arrinis looked at him and cocked an eyebrow.  He shrugged.  So did she.  Either she had no idea what an escape pod was, which was more than likely, or she didn’t appreciate him ruining her ‘moment’, or both.  The man made a mental note to send a distress signal for those pods, or release a nav buoy, or otherwise let someone know where they were.  Arrinis’ ploy that *really* wasn’t a ploy at all had worked perfectly.  The mob of slaves and the handful of remaining crewman had dispersed in every single direction but the one that took them near him and his companions.    He had to admit, she was quite intimidating.  In the dark of that hold, just after their rescue, while chewing on half a crewman, she was genuinely terrifying.  In the abstract, she was a lot like the worst alien space horrors that cinema had to offer.  It was more than just her bearing and behavior, as his arm could attest.  And he had booped her snoot, daring her to eat him.  Her vision must have adjusted sufficiently and her strength returned, as she wasted no further time in jumping down from Ghinta’s back and joining him at the other woman’s side.  “Two more decks ‘til we’re safe,” the deer-taur said.
